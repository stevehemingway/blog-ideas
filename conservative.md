The world of my childhood had coal fires (when it got really cold), 
two TV channels (BBC 2 was a great addition, once we got a 625-line set, although the picture was terrible), no telephone, no internet, no computers, no car, no bathroom. Don't feel sorry for me. I didn't see myself as poor. I was in much the same boat as my neighbours. My parents were a bit older, and hadn't participated in the economic boom of the fifties so much, but we had a roof over our head and access to excellent education, libraries, radio, healthcare.


All these things have gone. My life has changed out of all recognition. I may not be rich, but I have my own bathroom now. 

[make the case for not being a conservative by focussing on the small things.]
