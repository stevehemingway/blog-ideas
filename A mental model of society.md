# A mental model of society

We need a simple model of how society is organized. One class, two classes, three classes; some mechanical rules about how members of each class respond to some incentives. Have to have some model of politics and voting.
Try to incorporate something from Marxism, from selectorate theory, from Gary Becker, etc.

Maybe some model of family formation, childbearing, associative mating, crime as a rational choice, addiction, work vs. leisure etc.

Better throw in taxes and rational choice. 

While we're there, might as well incorporate public choice theory.
