Summary: A model of interest rates from Kevin Erdmann

He posits two distinct asset types, with interest rates being determined by changes in risk appetite, as savers move from simply want to defer their spending power to wanting to get a return on their investments. He argues that there is a negative real return to fixed income, relative to real assets, which return a flat 6%, expected. 

Certainly, thinking about all interest rates as simply being "the price of money" or the "marginal return on capital" might be too simplistic.
