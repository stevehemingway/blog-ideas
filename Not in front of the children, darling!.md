# Not in front of the children, darling!

As humans, we shy away from discussing tough topics.

- Biden's incapacity,
- The projections for the deficit (or PSBR, as it used to be called),
- the fact that training is not a substitute for native intelligence,
- the fact that we might earn more than the person we meet at a dinner party,
- anything to do with status, really, outside of very private conversations,
- the fact that a lot of businesses rely on identifying customers who are very bad at judging value for money and then selling them stuff they don't need.
 - in a properly democratic system, 51% of the population should vote themselves 100% of the money. Politicians don't like what would likely follow from such an election and suppress parties that tend towards offering this policy. It's not sustainable. Democracy itself is not sustainable, without some sort of dishonesty from politicians.
