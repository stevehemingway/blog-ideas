@# School vouchers

https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-school-vouchers-esa-private-schools

I grew up reading Milton Friedman. 
Now I am older, I can see that some of his brilliantly simple solutions to intractably complex problems may not work as expected. 

One issue is school choice. Milton advocated for the use of vouchers. Parents would be able to get their kids educated anywhere. Bad schools would lose income and would close down. Good ones would grow. Schooling would still be free, but incompetent heads and teachers would be eliminated.

Well, apparently, it doesn't work so well: Propublica has a piece, [here](https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-school-vouchers-esa-private-schools) about the problem, which is that poor parents can't afford the transport costs to get their kids to the best schools, which tend to be in the posh neighbourhoods.

A less radical proposal was to select kids by ballot, when a school is over-subscribed. (In the UK, at the end of primary school, you can choose maybe three local schools you'd like to send you kid to, and rank them in order of preference.) Some schools, when they had too many first-choice applicants, use a ballot to choose a subset. This was ruled illegal, by Ed Balls, education minister at the time.

Alastair Campbell, a big beat Labour figure, argued that choice was all wrong. The solution was to make every school excellent. Somehow, this seems an accepted argument, even though it makes no sense to me.

Good schools make a big difference. I got lucky. Most do not. It's a great pity that the school system is terrible, because changing anything is impossible because of the entrenched ideological positions that both major parties have adopted.
