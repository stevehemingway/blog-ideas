# Transparency International Report on Covid Procurement

Transparency International, not an organization which devotes a lot of its time to the UK, produced a damning report on the procurement of PPE by the UK government during the pandemic.
It identified the following concerns. 

- Political connections: 28 contracts worth £4.1 billion (nearly 10% of pandemic spending) went to those with political connections to the governing party.
- VIP Lane: 51 contracts worth £4 billion went through the unlawful "VIP lane," with 24 contracts (£1.7 billion) referred by government politicians.
- Inexperienced suppliers: 8 contracts worth £500 million went to suppliers less than 100 days old.
- Lack of competition: Over £30.7 billion in contracts (nearly two-thirds by value) were awarded without competitive bidding.
- Poor transparency: 141 high-value contracts worth £5 billion were published more than a year after being awarded.

For a while, in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic, these contracts were a national scandal, and were always in the news. But now, the caravan has moved on. We are so transfixed by the spectacle of Trump that we've simply forgotten about this egregious episode.

I think that a common response is "OK, we knew the Tories were corrupt. They screwed us, the taxpayers, during the pandemic, but we've kicked them out so it won't happen again." 
Really? Losing an election to end up as a lobbyist or a purveyor of dull speeches for millions of pounds [1] is a just punishment?

But a widely held view is that "They (politicians of mainstream parties) are all the same." If this is true, then what is to stop such a scandal, or at least a comparable one, happening again under Labour? Nobody seems to have asked "How can such a scandal happen in a country like ours that has so many rules which are supposed to prevent precisely this sort of thing happening?" 

The same sort of thing seems to have happened in the US. Everyone seems to agree that the US president has too much power, and that it needs to be curtailed, and that this is something they would do when they get back into power. But what actually happens is that once their guy does get back into power, they revel in the power, and even expand the scope of it. All opposition parties in FPTP electoral systems agree that it's a terrible system, right up to the point that they manage to win an election under it.

The common theme is that 'emergency powers' are invoked. Pesky things like oversight, and scrutiny, are too difficult when lives are at stake. So, we they are jettisoned. Except that the guy who is being constrained is the guy who can declare a state of emergency. 

Presidents, of both parties, seem to be able to ignore the checks and balances that one would have hoped constrain them from actions like going into war in Iraq, and invading Afghanistan. 


The situation seems to be actually worse in the UK than in other countries. As a Brit, I find this shocking. I knew we were slow, bureaucratic, over-regulated, technophobic, and phobic about electricity in bathrooms. But I didn't know that procurement was as corrupt as in a banana republic. From what I can tell, the Ukraine had far more transparent and fair procurement processes in place. 








Covid procurement was egregiously corrupt. It's hard to believe that common or garden procurement is completely free from corruption, even though the more relaxed timescales might make the problem less bad.

So, why was reporting so bad? Why was the UK so much worse than, for example, Ukraine?

When people move in mysterious ways, it's usually about incentives.
