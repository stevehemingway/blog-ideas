I recently attended a comedy night where scientists took the stage, and let me tell you, it was a real laugh riot – or should I say, a cry fest? The comedians were, how can I put it, delightfully miserable.

University life is a blast, and doing a PhD is like being part of a exclusive club, especially if you get the golden ticket – funding. But then, reality hits: no jobs, or at least not ones that pay more than a barista's wages. The vibe I got was that these brainiacs were stuck in a never-ending cycle of poverty.

These gifted young (and not-so-young) folks were hilarious, but their jokes were laced with bitterness about their meager salaries. One comedian based his entire set on the thrilling world of grant applications – because, apparently, that's what post-docs spend most of their time doing. It's like a never-ending game of "who can write the most captivating proposal," but with only one winner. Talk about a sinkhole of talent!

Another performer hilariously described her day job: writing protocols for DNA sequencing. It's all about pipettes – lots and lots of pipettes. I assumed this was the kind of task you'd assign to a lab assistant, but nope, it's the post-docs' gig now. They're like the interns of the scientific world, but with PhDs.

The show was entertaining, but I felt for the performers. They'd jumped through all the hoops, and yet, the system had left them high and dry. No pot of gold, just a handful of copper coins.

The UK government's big on investing in infrastructure between Oxford and Cambridge to boost productivity. But maybe they should try a different approach: manpower planning. It's time to stop churning out PhDs like they're going out of style and either create more jobs or tell universities to stop accepting so many grad students. Cambridge limits its undergrad numbers, but grad students just keep on coming. It's like a never-ending supply of cheap labor for the tenured elite.

Nobody feels sorry for Cambridge grads; they're always employable. But still, it's a bit like having a degree from the "University of Unemployment" – just kidding, it's Cambridge! Seriously, though, something's gotta give.

Yeah, me too! It actually wasn’t bad, and there was a decent audience.
