I met a guy yesterday, of a similar age to me, who talked about Bitcoin.
He told me how one of his children was sinking his (the child's) savings into bitcoin.
He strongly approved of saving in general, and simply accepted that investing in bitcoin was
as good a way of saving as any.
He was of the view that one could not rely on the state to support one in old age, and that therefore saving was critical,
and that what you saved your money in didn't really matter.

The motto of the Bitcoin crowd is "Have fun staying poor." Who am I to argue that Bitcoin is going to zero?
Jamie Dimon stated that Bitcoin was a Ponzi scheme, but now his bank allows depositors to buy it, and 
put their savings in Bitcoin ETFs.
Rational thought can take you only so far. As Marx said, "I have principles, but if you don't like 'em, I have others."
(Groucho, not Karl, hopefully obviously.)

As more Bitcoin in particular, and crypto-currencies in general, are endorsed by mainstream institutions, their value goes up.
Gold has a minor use in electronics, dentistry and jewellery, but it mostly gets dug out of a hole in the ground, transported to New York (or Zurich) and put in a different hole in the ground. My definition of an asset is something that generates a stream of income (cash or other benefits) over time. A T-Bill is an asset, as it returns coupon and principal cashflows over its life. 
A house is an asset, because if you live in it you receive the benefits of shelter over time.
A painting gives pleasure, and the warm feeling that if it's not a print, that your ownership excludes the ownership by others.






Belief is central to our lives.
What we know, is all we are.
By construction, what we don't know has no effect on how we behave.
