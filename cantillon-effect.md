Money is an illusion. 
Consumption is the sole purpose of economomic activity, according to Keynes.
The point about money is that it is not a consumption good. 
It can be exchanged for consumption goods, but it is not a consumption good itself.
This, surely, is fully understood by Rachel Reeves, but she still talks mostly about
money, and about `government money', as if the government had money that did not have 
to tax, or borrow, from the productive sector of the economy. Or borrow it from the Bank of E ngland, which is the same thing.

All these things boil down to the same thing: some production that would have been consumed directly by the population is instead consumed by the same people, but paid for indirectly. If government raised taxes, but the used the money to pay for exactly the same
shopping basket that taxpayers would have spent their own money on, then the effect of this government spending would be precisely nothing. But it's almost impossible to match
tax payment and benefits. Taxation means redistribution of consumption, and rebalancing production, away from that magical, perfect allocation that would be the outcome 
of a perfectly free market with no public sector.

In a two-commodity economy, say coconuts and fish, one might imagine production and consumption being brought into balance by the price mechanism, with the price of coconuts rising relative to fish, or vice versa. But in an economy of coconuts, fish, and a railway network, this simply won't happen. Goods which require large-scale coordination would not get built. Nuclear power stations, for example, would not get built, although possibly school lunches could be left to individuals to sort out, with cash transfers to the poor.

Although we think of railway networks as being built by the state, they were all built originally by speculative private investors. Investors who subsequently lost their shirts, but at least left a legacy of a functioning public transport system.

Somehow, the arguments for what needs to be built is never made. Even when it is made, the government is often evasive, and sometimes downright dishonest. The UK's first fleet of nuclear reactors were built to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, not to generate electricity. The government has never been honest about this, which has created a legacy of distrust in the governments motives for building nuclear power stations.

Chancellors always want to pretend that more can be spent, without actually raising taxes, or borrowing. This is the same as saying that the government can consume more than it produces, which is a lie. The government can only consume what it has taken from the productive sector of the economy, either by taxation or borrowing. Borrowing is just deferred taxation, and it is dishonest to pretend otherwise.
The get-out-of-jail card is to argue that the redistribution of production into something, usually `investment', will create growth, and increased labour productivity, which will defeat Ricardian Equivalence.
You can tell that I'm not convinced by this argument.
Today's spending review is just the last in a long series. I hope that it really is different this time, but I fear that it will not be.
