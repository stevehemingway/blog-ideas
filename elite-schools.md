The notion that elite schools like Harvard and Yale have become luxury goods is a fascinating phenomenon that warrants exploration. Luxury goods are typically characterized by their high price, exclusivity, and prestige. In recent years, these institutions have indeed taken on these characteristics, with their fees skyrocketing and their admissions becoming increasingly selective.

One of the primary drivers behind the transformation of elite schools into luxury goods is the increasing demand for their degrees. As the global economy has become more complex and competitive, the value of a degree from a top-tier institution has risen. Employers are willing to pay a premium for graduates from these schools, who are perceived to possess a certain level of intelligence, work ethic, and social status. This has led to a surge in applications, allowing these institutions to be highly selective and, consequently, more exclusive.

The rising costs associated with attending these elite schools are largely driven by factors such as faculty salaries, research initiatives, and infrastructure development. For instance, Harvard's endowment has grown significantly over the years, but a substantial portion of it is tied up in investments, making it difficult for the university to use it to reduce tuition fees. Additionally, the increasing demand for financial aid and the need to maintain a diverse student body have also contributed to the rising costs.

As a result, the fees at these institutions have increased dramatically, making them more akin to luxury goods. The total cost of attending Harvard, for example, now exceeds $70,000 per year, with some estimates suggesting that it could reach $100,000 in the near future. This has led to concerns that these institutions are becoming inaccessible to all but the wealthiest students.

The trajectory of fees at elite schools is likely to continue upward, driven by the ongoing demand for their degrees and the increasing costs associated with maintaining their academic excellence. This will likely lead to a further stratification of the student body, with those from wealthier backgrounds being overrepresented.

The students who will study at these elite schools in the future are likely to be drawn from a narrower segment of the population. As the costs continue to rise, students from lower-income backgrounds may find it increasingly difficult to attend, unless they receive significant financial aid. This raises concerns about the diversity and inclusivity of these institutions, as well as the potential for perpetuating social inequality.

For those who cannot afford to attend elite schools, cheaper, AI-driven instruction may become an increasingly attractive alternative. Online learning platforms, such as Coursera and edX, have already made high-quality educational content more accessible and affordable. The use of AI in education is also becoming more prevalent, with some institutions using AI-powered adaptive learning systems to personalize instruction.

While AI-driven instruction may not offer the same prestige as a degree from an elite school, it can still provide students with valuable skills and knowledge. Moreover, it can be more flexible and accessible, allowing students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.

In conclusion, the transformation of elite schools into luxury goods has significant implications for their fees, student body, and the broader education landscape. As the costs continue to rise, it is likely that these institutions will become even more exclusive, potentially exacerbating social inequality. Cheaper, AI-driven instruction may provide an alternative for those who cannot afford to attend elite schools, but it is uncertain whether it can replicate the same level of prestige and career opportunities.
While there's no straightforward answer, research suggests that higher education serves multiple purposes, including both acquiring valuable skills and networking/signalling ability. Let's break it down:

**Valuable Skills:**

1. **Cognitive skills**: Higher education helps develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, which are valuable in many careers.
2. **Domain-specific knowledge**: Students gain in-depth knowledge in their chosen field, preparing them for careers that require specialized expertise.
3. **Transferable skills**: Higher education fosters skills like communication, teamwork, and time management, which are transferable across various professions.

**Networking and Signalling Ability:**

1. **Social connections**: Universities provide a platform to connect with peers, instructors, and alumni, potentially leading to valuable professional networks.
2. **Signalling**: A degree from a reputable institution signals to employers that an individual has a certain level of intelligence, work ethic, and dedication. This can be particularly important in competitive job markets.
3. **Credentialism**: The degree itself becomes a credential, which can be used to demonstrate a level of competence or achievement to employers.

**The Interplay between Skills and Signalling:**

1. **Complementary effects**: Acquiring valuable skills and networking/signalling ability are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they can complement each other, as developing skills can enhance one's signalling value.
2. **Selection and sorting**: Higher education can serve as a sorting mechanism, where institutions and employers use academic credentials to screen and select candidates. This can lead to a signalling equilibrium, where the value of a degree lies not only in the skills acquired but also in the fact that it signals a certain level of ability.

**Empirical Evidence:**

Studies have investigated the relative importance of skills versus signalling in higher education. Some key findings:

1. **Returns to education**: Research suggests that the returns to education (e.g., higher earnings) are not solely due to the acquisition of skills, but also to the signalling value of a degree (e.g., [1]).
2. **Sheepskin effects**: Studies have found that the "sheepskin effect" – the idea that the mere possession of a degree (the "sheepskin") has value – is significant, even after controlling for skills acquired (e.g., [2]).

In conclusion, higher education is likely a mix of both acquiring valuable skills and networking/signalling ability. While there's ongoing debate about the relative importance of these aspects, it's clear that both play a role in shaping the value of higher education.
