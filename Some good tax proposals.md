## Tying immigration targets to house prices

Instead of having a fixed immigration target, the UK could tie its immigration policy to the state of the housing market. When house prices are rising rapidly, immigration could be reduced to alleviate pressure on the housing market. Conversely, when house prices are stable or falling, immigration could be increased to support economic growth.

This approach could help to mitigate the negative impacts of high immigration on housing affordability and reduce the strain on public services. It could also provide a more nuanced and responsive approach to immigration policy, rather than relying on a fixed target.
