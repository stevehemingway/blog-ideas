Blair was not a Politician
Everyone knows the arc of Margaret Thatcher’s career. Frustration and radicalisation in the ‘70s. The experiments that boosted finance and collapsed industry in the ‘80s. The final battles over Europe.

No one understands Blair’s trajectory.

This is because Blair was not a politician. “I was never really in politics,” he said in 2000.[i] “I don’t feel myself a politician even now.”

After leaving office, he created the Tony Blair Institute. Not a political party. Not a think tank. A global strategy consultancy.

He never saw himself as a Prime Minister in the traditional sense. He saw himself as a world-leading management consultant.

His inspiration came not from Marx or Keynes, but from McKinsey. The head of his delivery unit, Michael Barber, was indeed a McKinsey partner.

This is why he remains illegible to the British cultural establishment.

The UK’s educated class is trained in philosophy, history, literature. They are not expected to understand the grubby work of management.

The commentariat looked for a political philosophy. They found nothing. Because they cannot read management theory, they cannot read Blair.

Blair didn’t have a political theory. He had a management theory.

He was the avatar for a worldview promoted by global strategy consultancies in the 1990s. McKinsey. Bain. BCG. He took their slides and turned them into laws, regulations, institutions.

Without this key, his career remains encrypted: what he did, why he did it, and why it ultimately failed.

This essay attempts to decode his story.
