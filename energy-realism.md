According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2020, about 26% of global electricity generation came from renewable sources other than hydroelectric power, while hydroelectric power accounted for around 15%. Combining these, we can say that approximately 41% of global electricity generation came from renewable sources.

Here's a breakdown of the global electricity generation mix in 2020:

* Renewables: 41%
	+ Hydro: 15%
	+ Wind: 6%
	+ Solar: 3%
	+ Other renewables (geothermal, biomass, etc.): 17% (this includes a mix of various sources, with bioenergy being a significant portion)
* Non-renewables: 59%
	+ Coal: 37%
	+ Natural Gas: 23%
	+ Oil: 3%
	+ Nuclear: 10%
	+ Other non-renewables: 1% (this includes a mix of various sources, such as waste and other fossil fuels)

Keep in mind that these numbers are subject to change as new data becomes available, and the energy landscape continues to evolve. However, the trend is clear: renewable energy is becoming an increasingly significant portion of global electricity generation.

In terms of global electricity demand: it's 2.74TW. Global energy demand: 11.3TW. This pans out at about 2kW per person (bit less, as I used 6e9 as the global pop, but it's now nearer 7e9, but the energy figures are also out of date, and the global population is still growing.

With 60% of electricity from non-renewables, and essentially all non-electrical energy from non-renewables, we're looking at only 15% of global energy from renewables. This cannot possibly grow enough to seriously dent the output of CO~2. 

People argue that nuclear energy (whether from fission, or fusion) will save us, but even if we replace 100% of non-renewable electricity generation, we are still left with 75% of energy from fossil fuels, and 75% of current carbon going into the atmosphere.

Carbon-capture seems completely uneconomic. It seems to me that we need to seriously consider relocating a large part of humanity away from the equator, and committing a lot of capital into mitigation investment, such as flood defences, and irrigation systems where none were needed before (such as in formerly-rainy Britain).

The Net-Zero Zealots will be horrified by this analysis, but the above is an inconvenient set of facts.

Please don't accuse me of being a shill for Big Oil. I'd love it if they did give me even a modest stipend. I wrote this because although I believe in anthropogenic global warming, I simply cannot understand how the current policies to reverse it can possibly succeed.
