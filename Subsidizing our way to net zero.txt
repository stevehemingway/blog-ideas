	Heat pump sales across Europe fell by 47 per cent in the first half of the year as consumers lost enthusiasm for switching away from gas boilers, putting more pressure on the EU’s green agenda.

In the first six months of 2024, just 765,000 heat pumps were sold across the 13 big European countries, including France, Italy, Germany and Sweden, which collectively account for 80 per cent of the market, according to the European Heat Pump Association (EHPA).

Sales fell from 1.44mn in the same period last year, as fewer subsidies and lower gas prices lessened the incentive for households to switch away from gas boilers, the EHPA added.

Under plans published in 2022 after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine drove up the price of fossil fuels, the EU set a goal of installing at least 10mn more heat pumps by 2027.

Heat pumps heat or cool buildings by using electricity to transfer heat to and from the outside ground or air. They are widely seen as a solution to decarbonising household heating, when powered by renewable energy, but their adoption has been hampered by cost, a lack of qualified installers and wavering government subsidy schemes.
