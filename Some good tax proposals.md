Imagine you're a plumber, and you've just fixed a leaky faucet for a wealthy homeowner. They pay you Â£100, but you feel that the tax system is unfair because you're paying a similar tax rate to the homeowner who's making millions from renting out properties. 

One proposal to address this is to remove regressiveness from Council Tax, so that those who have more valuable properties contribute a fairer share. For instance, if the homeowner with the leaky faucet has a mansion worth millions, they could pay a higher Council Tax rate, while you, the plumber, would pay a lower rate on your modest home.

Another idea is to make stabilization of asset prices a goal for the central bank. This could mean that the bank takes steps to prevent housing prices from skyrocketing, making it easier for you, the plumber, to afford a home.

Linking immigration targets to house prices is another proposal. For example, if housing prices are rising too quickly, the government could reduce the number of new homes being built by limiting immigration, thus reducing demand and slowing price growth.
