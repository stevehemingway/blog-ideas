# The problem of asking and of safety

The world is not black and white. Risks are not easily quantifiable. The decision to take a risk cannot be outsourced. Maybe, this is the essence of the distinction between risk and uncertainty that Frank Knight wrote about so inscrutably.

Basically, if you ask a lawyer "should I take this risk", he'll say "No!", even if the expected loss is a lot less than the expected gain.

In science, some problems can be solved entirely from first principles. However, many experimental results cannot be related directly back to first principles, but can be explained by a sort of half-way house, a model which is consistent with first principles, but not directly derived from it. In physics, this would be described a phenomenological model. In other sciences, there is no equivalent word, because it vanishingly rare to make a quantitative prediction directly from first principles anywhere but physics.

A lot of important political issues revolve around estimating risk. The obviously big one is climate change. But many regulations, for example drug safety, water cleanliness, seatbelts, car design, child protection, also revolve around risk.

Our instinct, derived from out attitude to members of our family, is to rule any risk of death as unacceptable. If there is any possibility that some action we take will result in the death of one of our children, we'll be careful to avoiding taking it.

Even in the family, this is irrational. If we spend another Â£10K on a big modern car, on the basis that it's slightly safer than our old banger (maybe it has LIDAR), this is money that we cannot spend on vitamin suplement At the government level, this applies with a million times more. If the UK gets a shy new High Speed train, this might save the planet (a tiny bit), but the resoures spent on the capital an labour elements of this project
