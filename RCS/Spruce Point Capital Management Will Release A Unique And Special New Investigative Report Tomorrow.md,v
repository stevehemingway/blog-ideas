@# Spruce Point Capital Management Will Release A Unique And Special New Investigative Report Tomorrow

We are pleased to announce the release of a new and unique forensic investigative short-selling report tomorrow, May 8th on our website www.sprucepointcap.com ( {emailLinkId=556} https://www.sprucepointcap.com/ ).

**For those who missed our short report on Nuvei ( {emailLinkId=557} https://www.sprucepointcap.com/research/nuvei-corp ) (TSX / Nasdaq: NVEI), a stock that has since declined by as much as 83% and taken private at a vastly reduced valuation, there are important lessons to be learned.** When we exposed the shady business and dealings of Nuvei, we stressed heavily our concerns about management, and in particular the CEO, who we found to have made questionable claims about his education. We also pointed out that two executives, including the CFO, failed to disclose on their biographies stints at another public company that settled a non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice. We even doubled down on our short against Nuvei with a second report after its promotional event with Hollywood celebrity Ryan Reynolds ( {emailLinkId=558} https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-04-18/ryan-reynolds-on-fintech-investing-soccer-social-media-video ). We believe the lessons to be learned from this case study in short-selling are clear: sell fast when the CEO is not transparent about his education, when executives omit problematic roles from their biographies, and when companies depend on celebrities to generate hype around their stock.

**Tomorrow we will expose a Company that has what we believe is some of the worst management and board governance we've ever seen for a multibillion dollar public company.** We will express concerns about the CEO's education claims, and also the fact that he has omitted a position from his biography over two decades ago that we believe is highly instructive in gaining insights to his current managerial behavior and relationships. But our issue with the CEO is only the tip of the iceberg. **We were stunned to uncover that at least five executives and Board members of the Company are associated with an eye-opening seven public companies that had financial restatements.** We will lay out the case why we believe the Company's business strategy is so flawed that even Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway, which has a $190 billion dollar war chest at their disposal and who knows the business and industry, isn't choosing to follow the Company's strategy. We think it is because the business model is under more pressure than the promoters and management are leading investors to believe. Furthermore, given the executives' past associations with financial restatements, and anomalies we have recently identified with the Company's reporting, we believe the risk of financial misstatement is extremely high. Not surprisingly, there is no Clawback Policy in place in the event of fraud or misstatement, and the promotional Company has managed to tether itself to celebrities to juice the stock to near all-time highs, making the set-up for disappointment increasingly likely.

The full report can be downloaded tomorrow at www.sprucepointcap.com ( {emailLinkId=559} https://www.sprucepointcap.com/ ).
