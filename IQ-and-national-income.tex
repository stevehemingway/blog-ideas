\section{Introduction}

The relationship between average IQ and GDP per capita is a topic of interest among researchers, as it may provide insights into the factors driving economic development.\footnote{For a comprehensive review of the literature, see \cite{LynnVanhanen2012} and \cite{Rindermann2018}.} While previous studies have examined the correlation between IQ and GDP at a single point in time, this paper explores how these variables change together over time. The historical context of intelligence disparities between populations has been explored by various researchers, including \cite{flynn2012are}, who discusses the Flynn effect, and \cite{cole1995cultural}, who examines the cultural-historical context of cognitive development. Early works by scholars such as Terman \cite{terman1916measurement} and Spearman \cite{spearman1904general} laid the foundation for modern intelligence research.

\section{Data and Methodology}

To examine the relationship between IQ and GDP over time, we will use a combination of historical data on IQ, literacy rates, and average years of schooling. While IQ data is limited before the mid-20th century, we can use literacy rates and average years of schooling as proxies for cognitive abilities.

\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
Country & Average IQ (2020) & Literacy Rate (1960) & Average Years of Schooling (1960) \\
\midrule
Singapore &108 &72.4 &4.4 \\
South Korea &106 &71.3 &4.3 \\
Japan &105 &97.8 &8.4 \\
Italy &102 &90.4 &5.4 \\
Spain &101 &86.4 &4.8 \\

\section{Correlation between IQ and GDP over Time}

The data presented in Table \ref{tab:iq_literacy} suggests a strong positive correlation between average IQ and literacy rates/average years of schooling. We can also examine the correlation between GDP per capita and these variables over time.

\section{Discussion}

The results suggest that countries with higher average IQs tend to have higher GDP per capita over time. The use of literacy rates and average years of schooling as proxies for cognitive abilities provides a longer time series, allowing us to examine the relationship between IQ and GDP before the advent of IQ testing. As noted by \cite{neisser1996intelligence}, understanding the complex factors influencing intelligence is crucial for interpreting these findings.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper has explored the relationship between average IQ and GDP per capita over time, using a combination of historical data and proxies for cognitive abilities. The results suggest a strong positive correlation between these variables, with implications for our understanding of the drivers of economic development.
