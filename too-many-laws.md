Ronald Coase was a very great man.
He lived to a ripe old age, and managed to get a Nobel Prize, in spite of being sceptical of the value of 'blackboard economics' with lots of partial differential equations.

As the saying goes, when all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.
This saying could be modernized into 'when all you have is a careeer as a lawyer, the cure for all society's ills looks like a new piece of legislation'.

Section 21 restrictions.

The concept of "too much legislation, too little law" can be explored through the lens of Ronald Coase's economic theories and the broader critique of excessive legislation. Here's how these ideas intersect:

## Ronald Coase and the Problem of Social Cost

Ronald Coase is best known for the **Coase Theorem**, which posits that, in the absence of transaction costs, parties will reach efficient allocations of resources regardless of the initial assignment of property rights[5]. However, Coase's work also touches on the role of government and regulation. In "The Problem of Social Cost," Coase argues that government intervention through legislation can sometimes be inefficient, as it may not account for the full range of social costs and benefits[3]. This suggests that while legislation aims to address social issues, it might not always achieve its intended outcomes efficiently.

## Critique of Excessive Legislation

The critique of "too much law" or "hyperlexis" argues that there is an overabundance of federal laws and regulations, which can be overly complex, costly, and invasive[2]. This critique is echoed across all three branches of the U.S. government, with efforts to simplify and reduce regulations[2]. The concern is that excessive legislation can hinder economic activity and obstruct good governance[6].

## Intersection with Coase's Ideas

Coase's emphasis on voluntary exchange and the efficiency of market solutions can be seen as a critique of excessive legislation. If laws are overly complex or numerous, they may interfere with efficient market outcomes by imposing unnecessary costs and constraints on individuals and businesses. This aligns with the broader critique that too much legislation can lead to inefficiencies and undermine individual liberty[1][2].

## Conclusion

The idea of "too much legislation, too little law" reflects concerns about the overreach of government regulation and its potential to hinder economic efficiency and individual freedom. Coase's work highlights the importance of considering the full social costs of government intervention and the potential benefits of market solutions. While Coase's theories do not directly address the issue of "too much legislation," they contribute to a broader discussion about the optimal role of government in regulating economic activity.
