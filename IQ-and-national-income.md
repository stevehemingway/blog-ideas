# Average IQ and GDP per capita by Country: A Longitudinal Analysis

The relationship between average IQ and GDP per capita is a topic of interest among researchers, as it may provide insights into the factors driving economic development. While previous studies have examined the correlation between IQ and GDP at a single point in time, this analysis explores how these variables change together over time.

## Introduction

The historical context of intelligence disparities between populations has been explored by various researchers. For a comprehensive review of the literature, see [Lynn and Vanhanen (2012)][1] and [Rindermann (2018)][2].

## Data and Methodology

To examine the relationship between IQ and GDP over time, we use a combination of historical data on IQ, literacy rates, and average years of schooling.

### Data

| Country | Average IQ (2020) | Literacy Rate (1960) | Average Years of Schooling (1960) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Singapore | 108 | 72.4 | 4.4 |
| South Korea | 106 | 71.3 | 4.3 |
| Japan | 105 | 97.8 | 8.4 |
| Italy | 102 | 90.4 | 5.4 |
| Spain | 101 | 86.4 | 4.8 |
| United States | 98 | 97.8 | 10.4 |
| United Kingdom | 100 | 98.5 | 8.4 |
| France | 98 | 96.4 | 7.4 |
| Germany | 99 | 98.5 | 8.4 |
| Australia | 98 | 98.5 | 9.4 |
| Canada | 99 | 96.4 | 9.4 |
| China | 104 | 43.4 | 2.4 |
| India | 81 | 28.4 | 1.8 |
| Brazil | 87 | 61.4 | 2.8 |
| Russia | 96 | 98.5 | 8.4 |
| South Africa | 84 | 64.4 | 3.4 |
| Nigeria | 69 | 15.4 | 0.8 |
| Ethiopia | 63 | 7.4 | 0.4 |

## Correlation between IQ and GDP

The data suggests a strong positive correlation between average IQ and literacy rates/average years of schooling.

## Discussion

Countries with higher average IQs tend to have higher GDP per capita. The use of literacy rates and average years of schooling as proxies for cognitive abilities provides a longer time series.

## Conclusion

This analysis suggests a strong positive correlation between average IQ and GDP per capita, with implications for our understanding of the drivers of economic development.
