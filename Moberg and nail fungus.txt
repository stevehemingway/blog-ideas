This post is all kinds of gross. 
I don’t speak Swedish because unlike the swedes who can, I’m a dumb American.
It comes off as presumptuous about moberg’s management being wrong about their guidance.
I’m not very nice to Anna or anyone else working hard to actually go out and cure nail fungus, and I could be very wrong.
Things said in the post are hypocritical as the very description comes across as a pitch.
