Spain has a lot of generation via renewables, and yet has much, much cheaper electricity than the UK. (https://www.omie.es/en/market-results/daily/daily-market/day-ahead-price). My guess is that (i) solar panels just don't work that well in a cloudy, northern country and (ii) wind turbines are an expensive way of generating power, even in a windy country like ours.

To put this into perspective, let's look at some global data. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy2022, global fossil fuel consumption has continued to rise over the last thirty years. In1990, global fossil fuel consumption was approximately6,373 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). By2021, this had risen to11,048 Mtoe, representing a73% increase.

We've spent a lot of money subsidising renewables, even though our contribution to total CO2 output is very modest. The UK's CO2 emissions from energy combustion were0.9% of the global total in2021. Presumably, the motivation behind this was to set an example to the rest of the world. However, the brutal truth is that they are ignoring us. Global fuel consumption now is two and a half times what it was in1970, and has barely changed since2010, in spite of countries like ours retiring all our coal plants, because India and China open new ones quicker than the rest of the world close ours.

Let's examine the average electricity costs in OECD countries, along with the proportion of their generation that comes from renewables. Here is the list of OECD countries ordered by residential electricity cost in ascending order:

* Mexico:4.3-6.4 ¢/kWh USD (~25% renewables)
* Chile:5.6-7.5 ¢/kWh USD (~40% renewables)
* USA:12-15 ¢/kWh USD (~20% renewables)
* Canada:12-18 ¢/kWh USD (~65% renewables)
* Norway:15-25 ¢/kWh USD (~95% renewables)
* Japan:16-24 ¢/kWh USD (~20% renewables)
* Korea:16-25 ¢/kWh USD (~6% renewables)
* Australia:17-28 ¢/kWh USD (~25% renewables)
* Israel:18-25 ¢/kWh USD (~8% renewables)
* Turkey:18-28 ¢/kWh USD (~40% renewables)
* Spain:22-33 ¢/kWh USD (~45% renewables)
* Portugal:23-33 ¢/kWh USD (~60% renewables)
* Greece:24-35 ¢/kWh USD (~35% renewables)
* Italy:25-36 ¢/kWh USD (~35% renewables)
* Slovenia:25-36 ¢/kWh USD (~35% renewables)
* Estonia:26-37 ¢/kWh USD (~15% renewables, but high biomass usage)
* Czech Republic:27-38 ¢/kWh USD (~15% renewables)
* Slovakia:27-38 ¢/kWh USD (~25% renewables)
* Hungary:28-39 ¢/kWh USD (~15% renewables)
* Poland:28-40 ¢/kWh USD (~15% renewables)
* Denmark:33-44 ¢/kWh USD (~50% renewables, with a high proportion of wind)
* Germany:38-49 ¢/kWh USD (~45% renewables)
* Ireland:38-50 ¢/kWh USD (~35% renewables)
* Belgium:39-51 ¢/kWh USD (~20% renewables)
* Netherlands:40-52 ¢/kWh USD (~20% renewables)
* UK:40-55 ¢/kWh USD (~40% renewables)
* Switzerland:42-55 ¢/kWh USD (~60% renewables, mostly hydro)
* Austria:43-56 ¢/kWh USD (~75% renewables, mostly hydro)
* Luxembourg:44-57 ¢/kWh USD (~15% renewables, but high imports)
* France:45-58 ¢/kWh USD (~25% renewables, with a high proportion of nuclear)

The data suggests that there is a wide range of electricity costs across OECD countries, and that the cost is not directly correlated with the proportion of renewables in the energy mix. Some countries with a high proportion of renewables, like Norway, have relatively low electricity costs, while others, like Denmark and Germany, have among the highest electricity prices in the world.

This raises questions about the effectiveness of our current approach to reducing CO2 emissions. Perhaps it's time to rethink our strategy and focus on more practical solutions that can be implemented globally, rather than just setting an example that others are not following.
