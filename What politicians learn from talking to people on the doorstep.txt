Summary: What politicians learn from talking to people on the doorstep
Description: In a tiny way, I have spent time knocking on doors and asking people for their opinions about politics, as a footsoldier in the never-ending battle for votes. There is only one piece of information we want: whether or not you will vote for us.

We really don't give a damn about persuading you about anything. We just want to avoid reminding you to vote if you're likely to vote for the other lot. 

Interest in politics is a luxury belief. People on the margins, of managing, or of being bothered about whether or not to vote, don't give politics much thought. Supposedly, they think about politics for four minutes a week. They really don't give a stuff about anyone's policy on what to do with the Chagos Islands. Frankly, it's hard to imagine foreign policy tipping the way any normal voter decides to cast his vote.

Unfortunately, politicians take on board what they hear on the doorstep. They take on board that policies really don't matter. Image, soundbites, appearing on Strictly, not letting a billionaire buy your glasses for you, being a football supporter and going to matches. These all matter much more. 

One thing that really, *really* doesn't matter, for a backbench MP, is diligiently reading all the bills forensically and holding the executive to account. That one thing that, literally, has a zero yield, in terms of votes gained. Sigh.
