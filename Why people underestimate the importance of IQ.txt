Summary: Why people underestimate the importance of IQ
Description: I used to be a governor of a primary school. One of the endless series of fad directives that were being sent out at the time by the minister for education was the demand that primary schools teach some grammar.
This requirement was derided at the time by the educational establishment based on some cherry-picking of evidence (the minister wanted children to correctly identify and use 'fronted adverbials'). 

Anyway, a teacher at the school found the grammar difficult to understand, and (presumably) impossible to teach. The response of the head was to decide that what was needed was more professional training. Nobody dared suggest that, just maybe, someone who struggles to understand the grammar of his mother tongue is simply not clever enough to be a teacher.

I think that part of the problem of recognizing the limits to teaching is that our day-to-day contact is mostly with people whose intelligence is not very different to ours. Fellows dining on high table in an Oxford college hall will differ widely in their knowledge and views on the world, but won't vary hugely in how clever they are. Or, at least, most of them will not attribute divergence of views to divergence of intelligence.

This leads to the idea that it's possible to set up a place of learning, and fix the lack of skills that discourages industry setting up places of work in deprived areas. Nobody argues that all the smart people got out of those areas years ago, and so it's too late for regeneration.

After the poor reception to the idea of teaching grammar, the minister fought back by labelling the establishment 'The Blob' and sticking out his tongue at it. OK, the minister was Michael Gove. Oh, and after praising his work, Cameron replaced him by someone who he knew would be more acceptable to the teachers: Nicky Morgan.
