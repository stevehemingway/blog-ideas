Summary: Religion as a parasite
Description: Parasites evolve to be less and less harmful to their hosts. Some transition into symbiotic elements: e.g. mitochondria.

Maybe make this post more wide-ranging as you bring in some ideas from Divine Economy. 

Most religions that have ever existed are gone and forgotten.

Close links with politics. 

Competitive environment.

Gradual substitution of immanent religions (Ancient Greek) with transcendental ones (Christianity).

Religion has to deliver benefits. Creating a community is possibly the biggest one.

The Evolution of Religion: From Parasitism to Symbiosis

Throughout human history, religions have played a crucial role in shaping societies, cultures, and individual lives. However, the religious landscape has been far from static. Like biological organisms, religions have undergone a process of evolution, with some thriving and others fading into obscurity. This evolutionary journey of religion offers fascinating insights into the dynamics of cultural adaptation and the symbiotic relationship between belief systems and their host societies.

## The Parasitic Origins of Religion

In its early stages, religion often exhibited parasitic characteristics. Primitive belief systems frequently demanded costly sacrifices, imposed burdensome rituals, and sometimes even called for human offerings. These practices, while detrimental to individuals and societies, persisted due to the fear and superstition they instilled. Early religions exploited human psychology, leveraging our innate tendencies towards pattern-seeking and agency detection to create explanations for natural phenomena and life's uncertainties[1].

## The Competitive Religious Landscape

As human societies grew more complex, so did their religious beliefs. This led to a highly competitive environment where different religions vied for followers and influence. Much like biological evolution, this competition drove rapid changes and adaptations in religious doctrines and practices. Religions that failed to attract adherents or provide tangible benefits to their host societies often died out, explaining why most religions that have ever existed are now gone and forgotten[2].

## The Symbiotic Shift

Over time, successful religions evolved to become more symbiotic with their host societies. This transition mirrors the evolutionary journey of mitochondria, which began as independent organisms but eventually became essential components of eukaryotic cells. Similarly, religions that survived and thrived were those that offered significant benefits to their adherents and the broader community[3].

One of the most crucial benefits provided by religion is the creation of community. Religious institutions offer a sense of belonging, social support networks, and shared moral frameworks. This community-building aspect has been a key factor in the longevity of many major world religions[4].

## The Shift from Immanent to Transcendental Religions

Another notable trend in religious evolution has been the gradual substitution of immanent religions with transcendental ones. Ancient Greek religion, for example, viewed gods as immanent forces within nature. In contrast, Christianity introduced a transcendent God existing beyond the physical world. This shift allowed for more abstract and flexible belief systems that could adapt to changing societal needs and scientific understanding[5].

## Religion and Politics: A Complex Symbiosis

The evolution of religion has been closely intertwined with political power structures. Throughout history, religious institutions have often formed symbiotic relationships with ruling elites, providing legitimacy to political authority in exchange for protection and support. This relationship has shaped the development of both religious doctrines and political systems[6].

However, this symbiosis has not always been stable. When religious institutions became too closely aligned with unpopular regimes or failed to adapt to changing social values, they risked losing their influence. The Protestant Reformation, for instance, can be seen as a response to the perceived corruption and rigidity of the Catholic Church[7].

## Modern Adaptations

In the contemporary world, religions continue to evolve in response to societal changes. Many religious institutions have adapted their teachings to accommodate scientific discoveries, changing social norms, and the challenges of globalization. For instance, some branches of Christianity have reinterpreted biblical texts to be more inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals, while others have incorporated environmental stewardship into their doctrines[8].

## The Future of Religious Evolution

As we look to the future, it's clear that religions will continue to evolve. The rise of secularism in many parts of the world presents a new selective pressure, pushing religions to find new ways to remain relevant. Some scholars predict a continued trend towards more personal, individualized forms of spirituality, while others foresee a resurgence of traditional religious practices in response to the uncertainties of modern life.

In conclusion, the evolution of religion from parasitic beginnings to symbiotic relationships with host societies offers a compelling lens through which to view human cultural development. By providing community, meaning, and moral frameworks, successful religions have become integral parts of human societies, much like mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. As we face new challenges in the 21st century, it will be fascinating to observe how religions continue to adapt and evolve in response to changing human needs and understanding.
