Perplexity: 

A Section 106 agreement is a legally binding contract between a developer and a local planning authority that is linked to a planning permission. Here are the key points about Section 106 agreements:

## Purpose and Function

- It is designed to make a development acceptable in planning terms by securing contributions from the developer to mitigate the impact of the development on the local community and infrastructure[1][2].

- These agreements ensure that certain extra works related to a development are undertaken[3].

## Common Obligations

Section 106 agreements often cover:

- Provision of affordable housing
- Financial contributions for infrastructure improvements (e.g. transport, public spaces, education)
- Environmental improvements
- Employment and training initiatives[3][4]

## Key Characteristics

- They are site-specific and directly related to the proposed development[1][2].
- Must be necessary, relevant, and reasonable in scale to the development[1].
- Become registered as charges with the Land Registry until formally discharged by the council[5].

## Legal Basis

- Derived from Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990[1][2].
- Can be enforced against the person who entered into the obligation and subsequent owners[6].

## Relationship with Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)

- Section 106 agreements continue to be used alongside CIL, but are more focused on site-specific mitigation[6].
- CIL is designed to address broader impacts of development[6].

## Modification and Review

- Can be modified or discharged under certain conditions, typically after five years[6].
- Recent legislation allows for review of affordable housing requirements in some cases[6].

Section 106 agreements play a crucial role in ensuring that new developments contribute positively to local communities and infrastructure, balancing the pressures created by new construction with improvements to the surrounding area.
