Ricardian Equivalence is an economic theory that suggests changes in government spending or taxation policies don't affect the overall economy. It was proposed by Robert Barro in 1974. The idea is that if the government increases spending, people will expect taxes to go up in the future to pay for it, so they'll save more and spend less, which offsets the initial stimulus. Similarly, if the government cuts taxes, people will expect taxes to go up later and save more, which again offsets the stimulus.

The theory's relevance to the UK in the 2020s is up for debate. The UK has seen a big increase in public debt, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Ricardian Equivalence, if people think the government will raise taxes to pay off this debt, they might save more and spend less, which would offset the stimulus from increased government spending.

However, people's behavior doesn't always match the theory's assumptions. During the pandemic, many people increased their spending despite uncertainty about future tax policies. This doesn't remotely align with the idea that people are forward-looking and rational.

The current economic conditions, including Brexit and the pandemic, might make people more cautious and inclined to save, which could fit with the theory. The way the government communicates its plans can also affect how well the theory holds up. If the government is clear about its plans to balance the budget or reduce debt, people might be more likely to adjust their behavior accordingly.

It is a racing certainty that taxes will increase substantially in the Autumn Statement, probably by at least fifty billion pounds. People are not stupid. They will hold off large purchases and save more now, to reflect a decreased level of disposable income in the future. Nobody now believes that Labour will even attempt to target the ultra-wealthy as the source of these taxes, so the middle income earners, the guys making between a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand pounds will bear the brunt of the pain. Starmer promised that those with the broadest shoulders would pay. He obviously wasn't thinking of Rishi and his missus.
