I had a call today about a building and the requirements of the Building Safety Act 2022.
The act is a response to the Grenfell Tower disaster. 
Some would say it was a 'knee-jerk response', but only the British state could have a reaction time measured in years.
The call involved two lawyers, and a lot of money, and complete uncertainty as to the meaning of various terms (not) defined in the act.
Inevitably, expensive barristers will be involved, and we will be lumbered with costs but no benefits.

The act tries to improve the safety of buildings, but it seems clear that the tragedy itself was a consequence of various parties 
doing stuff _that was already illegal or in breach of building regulations_. Maybe it wasn't, but building regulations change all the time,
and they don't require an act of parliament each time.

Ronald Coase understood all this. Acts of parliament are rigid and are made by MPs who have a very poor understanding of the complex realities
of life, especially of those who will be impacted by the legislation. Each new piece of legislation may interact with other legislation in unanticipated
and perverse ways. The recent Supreme Court ruling on the definition of the term 'woman' is an example of this. 
The enumerating of 'protected characteristics' and the additional rights which those with those characteristics gain is a typical example of how a piece of legislation can explode 
the workload on those accidentally caught in its orbit. 
The devolution of the creation of legislation to innumerable regulators explodes the problem, undermining the principles that law should protect and making compliance difficult and
enforcement inconsistent (at best).

Governments increasingly introduce legislation another channel of virtue signalling, rather with the serious intent of improving the orderly functioning of society.
The 2008 Climate Change Act is Exhibit A in this case. The act simply sets targets for carbon emissions. We might all applaud the intention,
but an act to set binding targets on the number of murders committed per year in the UK, without saying how, would be laughed out of court â€¦ err, parliament.


Coase, as an economist who studied transaction costs and institutional structures, believed that legal systems work best when they establish broad frameworks within which individuals can negotiate and resolve issues, rather than trying to dictate specific outcomes through detailed regulations; I sincerely do too, and especially in relation to the 2022 Building Safety Act.

I would maintain that most of the legislation supposedly to save the planet from anthropogenic climate change is more about securing the votes of 
those who are anxious about the fate of the planet than 




Ronald Coase used to argue that we have too much legisl


Ronald Coase was a very great man.
He lived to a ripe old age, and managed to get a Nobel Prize, in spite of being sceptical of the value of 'blackboard economics' with lots of partial differential equations.

As the saying goes, when all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail.
This saying could be modernized into 'when all you have is a careeer as a lawyer, the cure for all society's ills looks like a new piece of legislation'. 
This is a reference to economist Ronald Coase's distinction between legislation (formal rules passed by governing bodies) and law (the broader system of principles that emerge to govern society).

When Coase made this statement, he was expressing concern that modern societies rely too heavily on detailed, prescriptive legislation rather than allowing more flexible and organic legal principles to develop. His perspective reflects several key ideas:

1. Legislation tends to be rigid and often fails to account for complex social realities and varied circumstances, whereas law can evolve through judicial interpretation and common practice to address nuanced situations.

2. Excessive legislation can create bureaucratic complexity that makes compliance difficult and enforcement inconsistent, while potentially undermining the fundamental principles that law should protect.

3. yyCoase, as an economist who studied transaction costs and institutional structures, believed that legal systems work best when they establish broad frameworks within which individuals can negotiate and resolve issues, rather than trying to dictate specific outcomes through detailed regulations.

4. He was concerned that legislation often represents short-term political interests rather than enduring principles of justice or efficiency.

This perspective aligns with Coase's broader work on how legal frameworks affect economic outcomes and his skepticism about top-down regulation versus emergent order in social institutions.
HMO regulations,
cladding regulations,

Section 21 restrictions.

The concept of "too much legislation, too little law" can be explored through the lens of Ronald Coase's economic theories and the broader critique of excessive legislation. Here's how these ideas intersect:

## Ronald Coase and the Problem of Social Cost

Ronald Coase is best known for the **Coase Theorem**, which posits that, in the absence of transaction costs, parties will reach efficient allocations of resources regardless of the initial assignment of property rights[5]. However, Coase's work also touches on the role of government and regulation. In "The Problem of Social Cost," Coase argues that government intervention through legislation can sometimes be inefficient, as it may not account for the full range of social costs and benefits[3]. This suggests that while legislation aims to address social issues, it might not always achieve its intended outcomes efficiently.

## Critique of Excessive Legislation

The critique of "too much law" or "hyperlexis" argues that there is an overabundance of federal laws and regulations, which can be overly complex, costly, and invasive[2]. This critique is echoed across all three branches of the U.S. government, with efforts to simplify and reduce regulations[2]. The concern is that excessive legislation can hinder economic activity and obstruct good governance[6].

## Intersection with Coase's Ideas

Coase's emphasis on voluntary exchange and the efficiency of market solutions can be seen as a critique of excessive legislation. If laws are overly complex or numerous, they may interfere with efficient market outcomes by imposing unnecessary costs and constraints on individuals and businesses. This aligns with the broader critique that too much legislation can lead to inefficiencies and undermine individual liberty[1][2].

## Conclusion

The idea of "too much legislation, too little law" reflects concerns about the overreach of government regulation and its potential to hinder economic efficiency and individual freedom. Coase's work highlights the importance of considering the full social costs of government intervention and the potential benefits of market solutions. While Coase's theories do not directly address the issue of "too much legislation," they contribute to a broader discussion about the optimal role of government in regulating economic activity.
