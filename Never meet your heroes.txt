# Never meet your heroes

When we grow up, with find people we idolize. As we get older, we learn that even the most saintly and talented individuals usually have feet of clay. In fact, the more charismatic a leader is, the more likely he is to be a failure as a human being. 

I assume this is because, as humans, we only have so much capacity for thought, doing good, caring for people. Those who care about the greater good, usually miss the suffering of those around them.

Biden ('Wall St. Always Wins'),
Nixon (?),
