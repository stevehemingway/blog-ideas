@# Maybe there are not diminishing returns to investment in marketing

My instinct is that consumers are able to assess the utility of what they consume, and that the mix of products they consume will be the utility-maximizing basket familiar to economists.

I don't suppose that anyone would think that increasing the price of some products to spend on marketing has no effect on consumer behaviour (if it didn't work, why would firms choose a non-zero marketing budget?).

I don't suppose if a product were produced with 100% of the costs expended on marketing would be profitable, outside of schemes which are entirely fraudulent, but may be ...?

Big Tech, which is mostly about marketing (FB, Google, even Amazon, even NFLX. Only AAPL and MSFT not) are 20% of US mkt cap, so 10% of  total stockmarket income... (debt, equity).
