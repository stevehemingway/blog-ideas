Summary: Transparency International Report on Covid Procurement
Description: https://www.transparency.org.uk/sites/default/files/pdf/publications/Behind%20the%20Masks%20Report%20Final_0.pdf

Quite depressing. Authorities publish data on procurement slowly and inaccurately. The people looking at the data are probably only doing so so to level criticism at them. Why should they go to any lengths to make it easier to do this?

Covid procurement was egregiously corrupt. It's hard to believe that common or garden procurement is completely free from corruption, even though the more relaxed timescales might make the problem less bad.
