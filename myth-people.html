<h1 id="the-myth-of-a-singular-will-of-the-people">The Myth of a
Singular “Will of the People”</h1>
<p>The notion of a singular “will of the people” is a myth. In reality,
a diverse population comprises numerous groups, each with their own
distinct views, values, and interests. These groups may overlap,
intersect, or even hold internally inconsistent opinions, making it
challenging to pinpoint a unified popular will.</p>
<h2 id="the-complexity-of-public-opinion">The Complexity of Public
Opinion</h2>
<p>Consider the problem with Israel and Gaza. Israel is the only country
in the Middle East with a modern, high-tech economy and a fully
democratic electoral system. It has close links with Europe and the USA,
and many of the residents there are the descendants of Jews who suffered
horribly at the hands of the murderous Nazi regime. Such a country
deserves the support of the west, but also the plight of innocent women
and children in Gaza provokes an outcry of sympathy, and widespread
belief that famine and murder are deliberate policies of the Israeli
government.</p>
<p>Any policy towards Israel, even a Trappist silence on the issue, is
guaranteed to provoke howls of outrage.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-of-aggregating-preferences">The Problem of
Aggregating Preferences</h2>
<p>In such a scenario, it’s possible for a government to propose a
policy that, while technically having the broadest support, still faces
opposition from a majority of voters. This might occur if the policy
appeals to a broad coalition of people but also alienates a significant
number of individuals within that coalition. Coalitions are bound
together as much by vetoes as by shared vision. The more fragile the
coalition (and the Labour Party is a prime example), the more options
are taken off the table, or are, at least, undeliverable.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-of-representation">The Challenge of
Representation</h2>
<p>The ‘majority’ is often an aggregation of highly disparate
individuals. Any given policy can expect to be unpopular among a
significant minority; and possibly even a majority. A government aware
of the disapproval of the populace for their policy might go on to
conclude that the policy does not, in fact, represent the ‘will of the
people.’ They could then choose not to implement it.</p>
<h2 id="paralysis-in-the-civil-service">Paralysis in the Civil
Service</h2>
<p>Such an outcome can lead to paralysis within the civil service. Faced
with the prospect of opposition from a significant portion of the
population, politicians may become hesitant to propose or implement
policies, even if they believe them to be in the best interest of the
country. This can result in a culture of indecision, where civil
servants and politicians prioritize avoiding controversy over taking
bold action.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-the-complexities-of-public-opinion">Navigating the
Complexities of Public Opinion</h2>
<p>The fear of being perceived as out of touch with the public can lead
to a cautious approach, where policymakers focus on incremental,
low-risk changes rather than more substantial reforms. This
incrementalism can be frustrating for those who advocate for more
significant change, but it also reflects the difficulties of navigating
the complex landscape of public opinion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ultimately, the myth of a singular “will of the people” can hinder
effective governance. By acknowledging and working within the
complexities of public opinion, governments can foster more nuanced and
inclusive decision-making processes. This might involve engaging in
extensive public consultations, seeking input from diverse stakeholders,
and developing policies that balance competing interests and values. By
doing so, governments can build trust and create policies that, while
not universally popular, are more likely to reflect the diverse needs
and perspectives of the population. Or, governments can fail to sell its
policies, because Reform has a better command of social media, and has
all that Russian money, and get kicked out at the next election. The
more likely outcome.</p>
