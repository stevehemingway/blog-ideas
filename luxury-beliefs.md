## Prompt

Give me an outline of an article on luxury beliefs. List the top seven such beliefs, as held by europeans and especially British politicians.

## Response

Here is a potential outline for an article on luxury beliefs, along with the top seven such beliefs held by Europeans and British politicians:

**Title:** "The Luxury Beliefs of the European Elite: How Out-of-Touch Politicians are Undermining Society"

**I. Introduction**

* Definition of luxury beliefs: moral or cultural values that confer status on the believer, but are often at odds with the interests of the less privileged
* Thesis statement: European politicians, particularly in the UK, are peddling luxury beliefs that are not only out of touch with the common people, but also harm the very groups they claim to help.

**II. The Top Seven Luxury Beliefs of European Politicians**

1. **"Open borders are a moral imperative"**: The idea that unrestricted immigration is a moral good, despite the strain it puts on public services and the impact on working-class communities.
2. **"Climate change is a greater threat than national sovereignty"**: The notion that international agreements and supranational institutions should take precedence over national interests in the name of combating climate change.
3. **"Diversity is more important than merit"**: The prioritization of diversity and representation over merit and achievement, leading to the devaluation of traditional standards and the marginalization of those who don't fit the preferred categories.
4. **"Globalization is inevitable and beneficial"**: The assumption that the global economy is a force for good, despite the significant economic disruption and inequality it has caused in many Western countries.
5. **"The nation-state is an outdated concept"**: The idea that national identity and sovereignty are relics of the past, and that a more globalized, cosmopolitan approach is the future.
6. **"Woke capitalism is the key to social justice"**: The notion that corporate commitments to social justice and diversity are a sufficient response to systemic inequality, rather than a potentially cynical marketing ploy.
7. **"Mass migration is a positive good for economic growth"**: The claim that large-scale immigration is necessary for economic growth, despite evidence that it can lead to downward pressure on wages and increased competition for jobs.

**III. The Consequences of Luxury Beliefs**

* Discussion of how these luxury beliefs are affecting different groups, such as working-class communities, small business owners, and traditional industries.
* Examples of how these beliefs are being implemented in policy, and the resulting consequences.

**IV. Conclusion**

* Recap of the luxury beliefs and their consequences
* Argument that European politicians need to be more in touch with the concerns and values of ordinary people, rather than pushing an elite agenda that benefits themselves and their peers.

This is just one possible outline, and the specific luxury beliefs and examples could be adjusted or expanded upon.
