@# Income dispersion as a public bad

It's very hard to be friends with someone whose income is very different from one's own. However much we'd like this not to be the case, it is. It's not just income, it's status, but they go together closely.

Give the example of Vincent Norton driving a bus. And Charles Stringham waiting on Nick Jenkins in the officers' mess.
