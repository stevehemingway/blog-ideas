# Transparency International Report on Covid Procurement

Transparency International, not an organization which devotes a lot of its time to the UK, produced a damning report on the procurement of PPE by the UK government during the pandemic.
It identified the following concerns. 

- Political connections: 28 contracts worth £4.1 billion (nearly 10% of pandemic spending) went to those with political connections to the governing party.
- VIP Lane: 51 contracts worth £4 billion went through the unlawful "VIP lane," with 24 contracts (£1.7 billion) referred by government politicians.
- Inexperienced suppliers: 8 contracts worth £500 million went to suppliers less than 100 days old.
- Lack of competition: Over £30.7 billion in contracts (nearly two-thirds by value) were awarded without competitive bidding.
- Poor transparency: 141 high-value contracts worth £5 billion were published more than a year after being awarded.

The situation seems to be actually worse in the UK than in other countries. As a Brit, I find this shocking. I knew we were slow, bureaucratic, over-regulated, technophobic, and phobic about electricity in bathrooms. But I didn't know that procurement was as corrupt as in a banana republic. From what I can tell, the Ukraine had far more transparent and fair procurement processes in place. 

I am sure that, in part, the problem was that the party in power, and the guy leading it, didn't trust the public sector to do anything in a sensible timescale. Most successful politicians these days treat running for office as a branch of showbusiness, but Boris Johnson seemed to treat actually governing the country as simply a matter of doing a lot of press conferences. I cannot, though, believe that this is the whole explanation. A lot of people saw the pandemic as a once-in-a-lifetime to get rich at the expense of the taxpayer; they must have influenced the way that this procurement was organized. The fact that the 'VIP Lane' was really a politically connected persons enrichment scheme, suggests that this needed some systemic elimination of the usual protections against procurement corruption.







Covid procurement was egregiously corrupt. It's hard to believe that common or garden procurement is completely free from corruption, even though the more relaxed timescales might make the problem less bad.

So, why was reporting so bad? Why was the UK so much worse than, for example, Ukraine?

When people move in mysterious ways, it's usually about incentives.
