Trump is dangerous, and might well be in office as the result of Russian interference with the democratic process. Russian misinformation was probably implicated in early "vaccine skepticism" and generally in eroding the trust that western populations, especially the less educated part of them, put in experts.

Therefore, anyone who promotes the idea that some vaccines may have limited benefits, in comparison to the harm they produce, is a Russian sock puppet. QED. 

Whoa! Hold on! This does not follow. If the Russian military intelligence agency (the GRU) promotes the idea that Trump is mentioned in the Epstein files, that does not, in itself, make it false. Sometimes propaganda is a matter of promoting, selectively, facts: just because it's true doesn't mean that it's not damaging to the enemy.
