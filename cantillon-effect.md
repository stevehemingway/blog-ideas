# The Cantillon Effect

## Money and Economic Activity

Money is an illusion. Consumption is the sole purpose of economic activity, according to Keynes.

## The Nature of Money

The point about money is that it is not a consumption good. It can be exchanged for consumption goods, but it is not a consumption good itself.

## Government Spending and Taxation

All these things boil down to the same thing: some production that would have been consumed directly by the population is instead consumed by the same people, but paid for indirectly.

## The Limitations of Government Intervention

If government raised taxes, but then used the money to pay for exactly the same shopping basket that taxpayers would have spent their own money on, then the effect of this government spending would be precisely nothing.

## The Importance of Understanding Economic Mechanisms

But it's almost impossible to match tax payment and benefits. Taxation means redistribution of consumption, and rebalancing production, away from that magical, perfect allocation that would be the outcome of a perfectly free market with no public sector.

## The Role of Infrastructure and Public Goods

In an economy with multiple commodities, including infrastructure and public goods, the price mechanism may not be sufficient to bring production and consumption into balance.

## Historical Examples

Although we think of railway networks as being built by the state, they were all built originally by speculative private investors.

## The Challenges of Government Decision-Making

The arguments for what needs to be built are never made. Even when they are made, the government is often evasive, and sometimes downright dishonest.

## The UK's Nuclear Power Program

The UK's first fleet of nuclear reactors were built to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, not to generate electricity.

## The Problem with Government Borrowing

Chancellors always want to pretend that more can be spent, without actually raising taxes, or borrowing. This is the same as saying that the government can consume more than it produces, which is a lie.

## The Reality of Government Finance

The government can only consume what it has taken from the productive sector of the economy, either by taxation or borrowing. Borrowing is just deferred taxation, and it is dishonest to pretend otherwise.

## The Limitations of Economic Policy

The get-out-of-jail card is to argue that the redistribution of production into something, usually 'investment', will create growth, and increased labour productivity, which will defeat Ricardian Equivalence.

## Conclusion

You can tell that I'm not convinced by this argument. Today's spending review is just the last in a long series. I hope that it really is different this time, but I fear that it will not be.
