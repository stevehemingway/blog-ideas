Summary: Science policy
Description: No leader of the developed world has a scientific training. It seems that when Patrick Vallance complained about Boris Johnson struggling with basic scientific concepts, other science advisors across the bloc produced a chorus of laughter.

As someone who is trained in science to the extent that he is trained in anything, this is rather shocking, but I suppose it's to be expected:

- science undergrad degrees are usually hard work. You don't get a lot of spare time to stand for election to The Union,
- voters generally do not understand science. Stephen Hawkins joked that the potential sales of his popular science books halved with each equation he added. Nobody will be elected who makes voters feel stupid by referencing complex mathematical or scientific topics,
- nerds make their money by making clever products and services. Bankers make their money by persuading their customers to do stupid things. Bankers make more money, and want politicians in their own image,
- politicians are often lawyers. Lawyers are famously Luddite in their approach to their work, an almost always come from the Arts Ladder at school,
- science isn't even a unified subject. A cosmologist doesn't know more about molecular biology than the man in the street. The idea that you can have a 'government science advisor' makes about as much sense has having a 'government religion advisor'.
