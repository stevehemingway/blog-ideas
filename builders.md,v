@# The problem with builders

Builders come in all shapes and sizes, but for most ordinary consumers, the local builder is the only one they will ever deal with.
Most people don't even get to do that: they live in a flat, and all major external work is done by contractors engaged by
the management company, probably via the managing agent. They may get a kitchen or bathroom re-fitted, but they will 
probably just buy a turnkey kitchen, with the shop subcontracting the fitting.

Some householders will engage a small builder to build a conservatory, or an house extension. This is the sort of builder I'm writing about today.
This builder will enter into a suitable contract with the client, and will probably subcontract the actual work to 'the trades' (i.e. the individual ground workers, roofers, joiners, electricians, plumbers, decorators etc.). The contract will probably be a template produced by the Royal Institute of British Architects, quite possibly the
JCT Minor Works Building Contract. It just like the contract you have with your energy supplier, your bank, even Amazon. You agree to pay money in exchange for a defined service. The law provides a framework through which you can obtain redress if you do not receive the service (building your extension) specified in the contract. Equally, the builder has protection from doing the work and not being paid the agreed sum. Except that it's probably not worth the paper (or bits) it's written on. Not because the contract is sloppily drafted, but because your builder is probably a limited company, and that limited company probably has no assets. 


 

In the UK, there are volume builders, like Persimmon, and Taylor-Wimpey.  And there are the guys who build your extension.
Actually, there are some middle-size firms that employ a lot of bricklayers, but actually are almost invisible to the general public,
because their only customers are the volume house builders, who don't actually employ any bricklayers at all, because
their value add is to get planning permission for the most profitable type of development, not to build anything better or cheaper.

The guys who build your extension are probably incorporated. I'm not sure if it's always been like this, but when Gordon Brown
dropped the Corporation Tax rate to ten percent for small companies, every dog groomer and his dog incorporated. Of course,
a year later when the rate disappeared, it became easier to remain incorporated, because going bankrupt as a limited company 
has far fewer consequences than doing so as a private individual. And the building industry is notoriously cyclical, and small 
builders go bust all the time. Because no building project every goes completely smoothly, and occasionally a client is sufficiently 
incensed that he withholds payment, or even sues successfully.

From the point of view of the client, this is a very bad situation to be in. However good the Minor Works Building Contract (https://www.ribabooks.com/jctminor-works-building-contract-2016-mw_9780414052543)
is, it doesn't help a client whose builder has gone into liquidation. The obvious reaction, one would have thought, is to avoid builders with thinly 
capitalized corporations. But you can't! None of them put any assets, beyond the odd van and office computer and printer, on the balance sheet. 
Maybe there are a couple of exceptions, but not where you actually need a builder. You can probably use a structural engineer who is based a hundred
miles away, you really, really can't use a builder who is so remote. There is not even any point in trying: he'll refuse to get into any sort 
of discussion.

The usual approach is to talk to a lot of builders, and possibly to their some of their previous clients (or, at least few who will good reference).
This can work, but it means that you have to have a lot of trust.

they employ contract lawyers and
planning law experts instead.
