@# Byrne Hobart -- The Diff

Hobart seems to have a great ability to think beyond the conventional boundaries of financial journalism.
He makes connections between technology, society, and the investment world. 
He seems to be able to see new developments in a bigger context, and relate them to historical analogues.

The only comparable commentator I can think of is Matt Levine, whose daily newsletter focuses on explaining the mechanics, 
and legal framework for various complex financial deals. 
Both are great at abstracting from a particular deal to making a more general point about the financial ecosystem.
Most people who work in finance are entirely focussed on one narrow eco-system, and probably have no idea how their field
relates to finance more generally.

I'm not sure that any of Hobart's newsletters can be said to lead to investment ideas, but they always leave me feeling that I have a deeper insight into the financial world.

Oddly, today (2024-12-17), Levine referenced Byrne in his column! (https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-12-16/elon-musk-heard-from-the-sec).
