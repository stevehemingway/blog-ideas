@# Write about how expectations and goals get reshaped by life

Think about your own life, what you wanted to do, how there was a feedback between what you wanted to do and what was possible.

Talk about being an engine driver and being Prime Minister.

Talk about the raised expectations of going to Oxford gave a distorted idea of what is probable or, realistically possible.

Talk about how, for you, going from a working-class background to a middle-class one involved learning a lot of cultural norms and navigating all sorts of relationships.

Don't make this into an autobiography.
