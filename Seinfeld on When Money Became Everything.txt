Summary: Seinfeld on When Money Became Everything
Description: SEINFELD: In the seventies, this is the tragic turn of American culture. And this was explained to me by Mario Joiner who cracked this puzzle that I could not figure out what the hell happened. That money became everything. What happened because it was not like that in the seventies. In the seventies, it’s how cool is your job? How cool is what you’re doing? If your job’s cooler than my job, you beat me.

BRENNAN: And no one said, how much are you making?

SEINFELD: Oh, you’re doing okay. You’re making this? Yeah. Who cares? And Mario Joiner explained this to me. He said the eighties was the first time that young guys could make a lot of money fast.

Never existed before. Rich guys were Aristotle Onassis, Andrew Carnegie, shipping, iron. You couldn’t make a lot of money fast in those days.

And it has poisoned our culture to this day. It’s poison.

I was reading in the Economist about why it was that the Silent Generation (those born in the 1940s) had been so dominant in US politics, right up to the present day. It argued that they had enjoyed such a rapid increase in living standards that they had been able to indulge in the luxury good called politics. Really poor people cannot do politics, because it's a  very risky way of earning money, even if for the very successful (Tony Blair) it can bring fabulous wealth.
