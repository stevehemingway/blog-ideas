# A new way of thinking about inflation

Real interest rates are pinned to the marginal utility of capital. If deferred consumption can't be turned into a real retun, then the real interest rate will go down. As more capital is created, the marginal return on capital will decrease, real rates will go down.

Nominal rates are, largely, controlled by central banks. The BoJ can keep nominal rates at zero indefinitely, and can do a pretty good job of yield curve control. But there has to be a means of reconciling the nominal and real interest rates, and this is the inflation rate. So this is, in one sense, a monetary phenomenon.

Tie this into exchange rates. Reconcile this with the idea that long-term rates link into the growth potential of the economy.
