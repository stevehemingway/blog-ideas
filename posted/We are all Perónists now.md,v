@# We are all Per贸nists now

Peronism is a political movement which is devoid of any ideology. It does not represent the poor (although it promises lots of goodies to make their lives better), or the party of the rich (although they won't suffer). It's not solely a nationalist party, promising to spend more on defence and on strenghening borders. It's all of the above, and therefore none.

It needs a personality to form a cult around. Originally, it was Eva Per贸n. Subsequently, it was a variety of larger-than-life characters. But now it's everywhere. The Conservatives under Boris Johnson was Per贸nist. The Labour Party is devoid of ideology, it's true, but Starmer just doesn't have what it takes to make the the movement truly Per贸nist. Maybe the flame-haired one, Angela Rayner, can play the part of Evita, leading the party to victory.

The old way of doing politics, where parties represent a particular factor of production: labour, land, capital, doesn't really work any more. Labour is too fragmented and disorganized, but nobody will vote for capitlalists, or even less landowners. So we have parties that don't want to offend voters, or donors. 

As long as the media play ball, this all works. But it's hard to control social media. China has done it, the UK is trying hard, and may well do it soon. The Orwellian-titled "Online Safety Act" is coming in, which will suppress "disinformation", in other words, information which is unhelpful to those in power.
