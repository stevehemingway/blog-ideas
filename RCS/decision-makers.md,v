@I do a certain amount of negotiating of rents and sale prices, on behalf a company.
I am not terribly good at this, but I am not completely hopeless. 
In particular, if I am selling something, I don't draw attention to its negative aspects.
If I provide comparisons, they are chosen to bolster my position.
Also, even if the final decision is not mine, I don't reveal that.
My position is not strengthened by my admitting that someone else has the final say. 
To admit a divergence of views amongst decision makers is to weaken one's position.

This is the problem with politics. 



provide information that would be to the advantage of the person I am negoti
