Question: *Is it the case that the Stanford marshmallow experiment tests obedience to authority, rather than willingness to defer gratification*

Answer: 

*The Stanford marshmallow experiment is designed to test delayed gratification, not obedience to authority. Here's why:*

*    The Child Makes the Choice: There's no authority figure telling the child what to do. They are presented with a choice and the experimenter leaves the room. The child decides for themselves whether to wait or not.*
*    The Focus is on Self-Control: The experiment is designed to see how well a child can control their impulses to wait for a bigger reward.*

*While some might argue the presence of an adult offering the reward introduces an authority element, the core test is on the child's internal struggle between immediate gratification and waiting for something better.*
