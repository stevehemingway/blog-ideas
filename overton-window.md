# What we can now talk about

I have always been anti-establishment. 
I have never been, and never will be, part of the establishment, and I have never felt the need to seek approval from authority.
I now regret having been so unwilling to abase myself, but I might as well make the most of it now that I am old.

In the past, there has been an argument that we mustn't let the state grow any bigger, because this will constrain productivity, 
which is the only thing we should care about, at least in the long term. 
Companies that think about nothing but maximising their share prices usually end up going out of business.
We have had government after government which announce that their main concern is to avoid the UK debt pile
growing any bigger, at least relative to GDP, on the basis that this would hamper growth. But it has anyway.
Maybe we've been doing it wrong all this time.
