# Good mission statements and real mission statements


Milton Friedman said that a company's only duty was to make money for their shareholders. 
All other stakeholders were to be rewarded, but only up to the limit set by their contractual entitlement and statutory protections.
Shareholders have no contractual rights, but take the residual risk of a company failing, 
so should be entitled to the totality of the residual income (if any).

Neoliberalism is deeply out of fashion.
No company wants to have as its mission statement "We aim to enrich our shareholders to the maximum extent permitted by law."
So, instead, companies say things like 

- "We’re in business to save our home planet."[^1]
- "..., and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis."[^2]
- "To accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy."[^3]
- "To make sustainable living commonplace."[^4]
- "Bringing health through food to as many people as possible."[^5]
- “building safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity”. [^6]

Actually, companies have never said to their customers "Our mission is to make you pay as much as possible for what we can make as cheaply as possible,"
but they didn't make up stuff about being in business to save the planet, apart from a few in the environmental vanguard like the Body Shop.

It makes sense for companies to sustain the fiction that they only exist to save the planet:

- it makes them more attractive as employers, especially to the top graduates of top tier universities,
- it makes people feel better about buying another tub of ice cream,
- it makes CEO's feel better about themselves, and gives them something positive to talk about with the wives of other CEOs at dinner parties,
- it pushes up their ESG ratings, allowing their companies securities to qualify for inclusion in ESG funds, potentially lowering their cost of capital,
- it differentiates them from their smaller, more traditionally run competitors. 

The problem is, the planet isn't being saved, or, at least, it's not at all clear that companies with these virtue-signalling mission statements are very different from the rest.

Several companies have faced pressure to scale back or alter their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) commitments due to various challenges, including economic pressures, political shifts, and practical implementation difficulties. Here are a few notable examples:

1. **Unilever**:
   - Unilever, known for its strong commitment to sustainability and ESG principles, faced investor pressure to prioritize financial performance over its ESG goals. In 2022, some major shareholders expressed concerns that the company was too focused on ESG initiatives at the expense of its core business performance.

2. **Danone**:
   - Danone, the French multinational food company, experienced a backlash from investors over its ESG focus. In 2021, CEO Emmanuel Faber was ousted following criticism that his strong emphasis on social and environmental goals had led to poor financial performance and stagnating sales.

3. **Shell**:
   - Royal Dutch Shell has faced legal and shareholder pressures regarding its environmental commitments. In 2021, a Dutch court ordered Shell to cut its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels, significantly impacting its business strategy. Additionally, some investors have pushed back against the company’s pace of transition away from fossil fuels.

4. **HSBC**:
   - HSBC, a major global bank, announced a commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, the bank faced criticism for continuing to finance fossil fuel projects. In response to pressure from both environmental groups and investors, HSBC has had to navigate the balance between maintaining its ESG commitments and its business interests in the energy sector.

5. **BlackRock**:
   - BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has been vocal about incorporating ESG into its investment strategies. However, the company has faced scrutiny and criticism for its investments in fossil fuels and other industries that are considered environmentally detrimental. This has led to a perception that the firm’s actions do not always align with its ESG rhetoric.

6. **H&M**:
   - The Swedish multinational clothing retailer H&M has committed to various sustainability initiatives, including using more sustainable materials. However, the company has faced criticism and legal challenges regarding labor practices in its supply chain, leading to questions about its overall ESG commitments and the balance between environmental and social goals.

These examples illustrate the complexities and challenges companies face in maintaining and balancing their ESG commitments with financial performance and stakeholder expectations.
