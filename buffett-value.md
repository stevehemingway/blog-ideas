Warren Buffett has been a vocal critic of certain corporate practices, including:

1. Stock-based compensation: Buffett believes that paying executives in stock is often a way for companies to justify overpaying their CEOs. He thinks it's a flawed system because it can lead to excessive CEO pay and creates an incentive for executives to focus on short-term gains rather than long-term success.

2. Awards of options: Buffett has expressed concerns about the proliferation of stock options as a form of compensation. He argues that options can be a misleading metric, as they don't necessarily reflect a company's true financial performance. Options can also create an environment where CEOs prioritize short-term gains over long-term value creation.

3. Share buybacks: Buffett has been critical of companies engaging in excessive share buybacks, which he sees as a way for management to manipulate the company's stock price and enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders.
