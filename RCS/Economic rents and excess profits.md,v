@# Economic rents and excess profits

# Economic rents arise from barriers to entry, a supply constraint. This can arise from natural shortages of supply: think de Beers and diamonds, or land for agriculture. 

But aren't all returns the result of some sort of supply constraint? Isn't an interest rate a reflection of the shortage of supply of capital, because people need to consume what they produce?

What about salaries and wages? Are high salaries for investment bankers a result on a genuine excess economic  production created by this sector, or are they a reflection of the very tight supply of bankers who are trusted to do large corporate deals? Or is it that there is a constricted supply of institutions and dealmakers who have the contacts and the track record that qualifies them to do the very lucrative financing deals that generate the added value that is, to a limited extent, shared by the insiders in those institutions?

Can we even distinguish between these returns? Are not all profits the result of a distribution of economic rents to the various factors of production?
