# The Myth of a Singular "Will of the People"

The notion of a singular "will of the people" is a myth. In reality, a diverse population comprises numerous groups, each with their own distinct views, values, and interests. These groups may overlap, intersect, or even hold internally inconsistent opinions, making it challenging to pinpoint a unified popular will.

## The Complexity of Public Opinion

Consider the problem with Israel and Gaza. Israel is the only country in the Middle East with a modern, high-tech economy and a fully democratic electoral system. It has close links with Europe and the USA, and many of the residents there are the descendants of Jews who suffered horribly at the hands of the murderous Nazi regime. 
Such a country deserves the support of the west, but also the plight of innocent women and children in Gaza provokes an outcry of sympathy, and widespread belief that famine and murder are deliberate policies of the Israeli government. 

Any policy towards Israel, even a Trappist silence on the issue, is guaranteed to provoke howls of outrage. 

## The Problem of Aggregating Preferences

In such a scenario, it's possible for a government to propose a policy that, while technically having the broadest support, still faces opposition from a majority of voters. This might occur if the policy appeals to a broad coalition of people but also alienates a significant number of individuals within that coalition.
Coalitions are bound together as much by vetoes as by shared vision. The more fragile the coalition (and the Labour Party is a prime example), the more options are taken off the table, or are, at least, undeliverable.

## The Challenge of Representation

The 'majority' is often an aggregation of highly disparate individuals. Any given policy can expect to be unpopular among a significant minority; and possibly even a majority. A government aware of the disapproval of the populace for their policy might go on to conclude that the policy does not, in fact, represent the 'will of the people.' They could then choose not to implement it.

## Paralysis in the Civil Service

Such an outcome can lead to paralysis within the civil service. Faced with the prospect of opposition from a significant portion of the population, politicians may become hesitant to propose or implement policies, even if they believe them to be in the best interest of the country. This can result in a culture of indecision, where civil servants and politicians prioritize avoiding controversy over taking bold action.

## Navigating the Complexities of Public Opinion

The fear of being perceived as out of touch with the public can lead to a cautious approach, where policymakers focus on incremental, low-risk changes rather than more substantial reforms. This incrementalism can be frustrating for those who advocate for more significant change, but it also reflects the difficulties of navigating the complex landscape of public opinion.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the myth of a singular "will of the people" can hinder effective governance. By acknowledging and working within the complexities of public opinion, governments can foster more nuanced and inclusive decision-making processes. This might involve engaging in extensive public consultations, seeking input from diverse stakeholders, and developing policies that balance competing interests and values. By doing so, governments can build trust and create policies that, while not universally popular, are more likely to reflect the diverse needs and perspectives of the population.
Or, governments can fail to sell its policies, because Reform has a better command of social media, and has all that Russian money, and get kicked out at the next election. The more likely outcome.
