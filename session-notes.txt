Advantages of Design and Build over Traditional Route:

1. Single Point Responsibility:
- One contractor handles both design and construction
- Reduces finger-pointing between designer and builder
- Clear accountability for project success

2. Cost Efficiency:
- Early cost estimating and value engineering
- Design tailored to construction methods
- Reduces change orders and cost overruns

3. Time Savings:
- Concurrent design and construction planning
- Faster project delivery
- Earlier occupancy/usage

4. Improved Communication:
- Collaborative team approach
- Better understanding of construction practicalities
- Reduced misunderstandings

5. Quality Assurance:
- Design-for-construction approach
- Constructability reviews
- Higher quality finishes

6. Risk Management:
- Early identification of potential issues
- Proactive problem solving
- Better contingency planning

7. Sustainability Focus:
- Integrated design for energy efficiency
- Material optimization
- Better environmental performance
