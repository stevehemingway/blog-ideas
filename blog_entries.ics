SUMMARY:Science policy
DESCRIPTION:No leader of the developed world has a scientific training. It 
 seems that when Patrick Vallance complained about Boris Johnson struggling
  with basic scientific concepts\, other science advisors across the bloc p
 roduced a chorus of laughter.\n\nAs someone who is trained in science to t
 he extent that he is trained in anything\, this is rather shocking\, but I
  suppose it's to be expected:\n\n- science undergrad degrees are usually h
 ard work. You don't get a lot of spare time to stand for election to The U
 nion\,\n- voters generally do not understand science. Stephen Hawkins joke
 d that the potential sales of his popular science books halved with each e
 quation he added. Nobody will be elected who makes voters feel stupid by r
 eferencing complex mathematical or scientific topics\,\n- nerds make their
  money by making clever products and services. Bankers make their money by
  persuading their customers to do stupid things. Bankers make more money\,
  and want politicians in their own image\,\n- politicians are often lawyer
 s. Lawyers are famously Luddite in their approach to their work\, an almos
 t always come from the Arts Ladder at school\,\n- science isn't even a uni
 fied subject. A cosmologist doesn't know more about molecular biology than
  the man in the street. The idea that you can have a 'government science a
 dvisor' makes about as much sense has having a 'government religion adviso
 r'.

  Bryan\, 1896\nThe director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\, 
 Rohit Chopra\, coined the term ‘junk fee\,’ and has begun restructurin
 g how financial markets work\, removing medical debt from credit reports\,
  fostering competition in credit cards\, and examining big tech’s entran
 ce into payments. And yet\, for ideological reasons\, to many bankers\, Ch

 nkers nodding their heads in furious agreement\, and even angry at their o
 wn trade association for helping a monopoly take advantage of them. Housin
 gWire’s James Kleimann and Sarah Wheeler were shocked\, calling it “Mu
 st-See TV.” \nThe Mortgage Bankers Association annual conference started
  with the typical attack on the government\, with President and CEO Bob Br
 oeksmit complaining about ‘regulatory knots’ while decrying government
  crackdowns on junk fees. CFPB Directors often attend these conferences to
  communicate with the industry\, and the conversations aren’t always ple
 asant. This one didn’t seem like it would be pleasant either. But Chopra
  went on stage a few hours later and discussed [ https://substack.com/redi

 DvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] an increasing cost center for banks\, whi
 ch is the credit bureaus and FICO. \n“Mortgage lenders in the U.S. incre
 asingly face a lack of competition when it comes to accessing data and rep
 orts needed for loan origination\,” he said. “In many cases\, a handfu
 l of firms have cornered the market\, allowing those companies to levy a t
 ax on every mortgage application or transaction in the country.” Three f
 irms dominate credit reporting: Equifax\, Experian\, and TransUnion. And j
 ust one company handles algorithms\, the Fair Isaac Corporation\, which se
 lls the FICO score. “Mortgage lenders have shared that costs for credit 
 reports and scores have increased\,” he said. “Sometimes by 400% since
  2022.” Chopra then went on to lay out some regulatory authority the CFP
 B has to impose price caps.\nThe audience\, surprisingly for a free market
  capitalist loving group of lenders\, was eating it up. Why? Well it’s t
 he same reason app developers hate Apple and Google\, or cattle ranchers d
 islike JBS\, or producers fear Netflix. The credit bureau cartel are gatek
 eepers to their market. And they are being squeezed\, increasingly losing

 1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] money on every
  mortgage they issue.\nConsumers pay for credit scoring\, but they do so i
 ndirectly. When someone is thinking of buying a house\, he or she visits a
  mortgage lender. That lender must buy a credit score from FICO and the bu
 reaus to see what that person can afford. When a customer takes out a loan
 \, that mortgage banker has to purchase another more complete report of cr
 edit information.  \nEven if a lender thinks the customer would be a good 
 risk\, the lender has to buy a FICO score regardless. Mortgage bankers don
 ’t carry the capital to hold the mortgages they make. Instead they make 
 a loan\, and then send it onward to the capital markets. First\, the gover
 nment guarantees most mortgages through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well
  as other programs for veterans and first time homebuyers. Then\, the gove
 rnment in turn sends these guaranteed mortgages to Wall Street. This compl
 ex process relies on a standard to price the loans\, and that standard is 
 FICO\, combined with the credit information from the three bureaus.  \nMor
 tgage bankers aren’t typical Wall Street bankers. While mortgage lending
  can be done by the big guys\, real estate is an inherently localized indu
 stry with a clubby network of realtors\, title insurers\, and various othe
 r specialists in the home-buying process\, so independent players have a s
 trong foothold. There are roughly a thousand independent mortgage lending 
 firms nationwide\, and these lenders live everywhere. So their anger at FI
 CO and the credit bureaus has an element of regional resentment\, since th
 ey are not Wall Street traders\, but are local community members trying to
  help people get homes.\nIn January of 2024\, the Community Home Lenders o
 f America [ https://substack.com/redirect/b1a59782-35e1-4684-ba9e-9261ed47
 8e13?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] disc
 ussed this dynamic with FICO\, calling it a utility\, which it is. The “
 combination of FICO’s extremely high market share\, and the fact that Wa
 shington agencies require lenders to use this company’s product\, means 
 that FICO has unilateral\, solid-gold market power\, the type rarely seen 
 in any US industry short of highly regulated utilities\, whereby rates are
  set by public-utility boards or commissions.” \nBut the companies thems
 elves know it and say it. In November 2011\, then-CEO of Fair Isaac\, Mark
  Greene\, explained that the “network effect” of “FICO Scores . . . 
 being sort of the standard language” and “having everybody . . . stand
 ardize on a FICO Score\, that’s magic.” FICO sells 10 billion scores e
 very year\, four times the number of McDonald’s burgers and twice the nu
 mber of Starbucks coffees sold annually. According to the company itself\,
  nine out of ten lending decisions rely on FICO. \nCredit scoring used to 
 cost a relatively small amount of money\, but now it can be up to $60 per 
 pull\, with the price quadrupling over the last two years for no reason wh
 atsoever. Only one out of every ten prospective customers ends up taking o
 ut a mortgage\, so higher prices fronted by mortgage bankers add up. And i
 t’s starting to be a major expense\, driving some of the mortgage lender
 s out of the business entirely. In other words\, Chopra\, though disliked 
 for calling out junk fees charged by bankers\, was actually attacking a ju
 nk fee that mortgage bankers themselves have to pay.\nAfter his speech\, C
 hopra and Broeksmit sat down for a public discussion\, and Broeksmit pushe
 d back on the criticism of FICO\, which had led the price hike charge. And
  here’s where it got fascinating. Broeksmit was supposed to be represent
 ing the mortgage bankers in his association. But Chopra pointed out that\,
  though it was a Mortgage Bankers Association event\, the session itself w
 as sponsored by FICO. “That was a wild moment right there\,” recounted
  Wheeler on the HousingWire podcast. The head of the Mortgage Bankers Asso
 ciation\, was being bribed by a monopolist to betray the bankers he was su
 pposed to represent. And he was just called out for it.\nCredit Is Identit
 y\nTo understand the roots of this fight\, we have to go back to the origi
 ns of credit reporting\, which extend deep into American history. For 150 
 years\, you could simply escape your debt by moving somewhere else\, and a
 dopting an entirely new identity. That’s the premise of the iconic Ameri
 can novel The Great Gatsby\, the story of a mysterious East coast tycoon w
 ho has hidden his past. Today\, The Great Gatsby couldn’t be written. Or
  if it were\, it would be a one page story\, in which someone runs a credi
 t check on a rich liar named Jay Gatsby. \nIn other words\, national credi
 t reports are foundational to modern American society\, binding us to one 
 another financially as a nation through a network of computerized records.
  And that national market of identity is relatively new. Until 1970\, cred
 it reporting was localized\, mostly through coops of town bankers who hire
 d detectives to investigate borrowers\, collecting gossip from snitches ab
 out who drank too much\, who was a Communist\, who slept around\, and so f
 orth. As the book The Naked Society noted\, bureaus looked at a consumer
 ’s "honesty\, potentially dangerous habits\, and manliness." Such inform
 ation was kept in large paper files\, it was secret\, and it could often l
 ead to someone never being able to get a job in a certain area\, and they 
 would never know why. A Gatsby was plausible\, since you could escape your
  debts and your very identity by leaving one state and moving to another. 
 \nCredit bureaus\, like the FBI who collaborated with them\, were creepy\,
  with no limits on their data collection practices. And they saw themselve
 s explicitly as disciplinarians. In 1968\, leading credit bureau Retail Cr
 edit Corporation President Lee Burge told Congress that the “availabilit
 y of record information imposes a discipline on the American citizen. He b
 ecomes more responsible for his performance whether as a driver of his car
 \, as an employee in his job performance\, or as a payor to his creditors.
  But this discipline is a necessary one if we are to enjoy the fruits of o
 ur economy and the present freedom of our private enterprise.”\nAfter a 
 lot of complaints\, Congress acted. In 1970\, the only woman on the Bankin
 g Committee\, Leonor Sullivan\, collaborated with Rep. Wright Patman and S
 enator William Proxmire to write and pass the Fair Credit Reporting Act. T
 his law eliminated the collection of the gossip\, which often included inf
 ormation on race\, gender\, and sexuality. FCRA gave consumers a set of ri
 ghts over their credit reporting files even though these files were held b
 y private firms\, and set limits on what data could be collected and how i
 t could be used. No longer was it acceptable to take someone’s sex life 
 and put it in a secret file\, with that information leading to the inabili
 ty to get a job for years. The new law treated the credit reporting bureau
 s as public utilities. \nFCRA was in a sense the last of the New Deal lega
 l arrangements\, passed at a moment of immense suspicion over government s
 urveillance\, part of a set of rules limiting the use of personal informat
 ion by the Federal government and corporations. But FCRA also structured t
 he national credit market\, fostering the computerization of credit inform
 ation nationwide\, and designed to regulate the emerging industry of credi
 t cards\, which had picked up steam during the 1960s. “When a man walks 
 into a bank to get a loan\,” said a Bank of America executive in Congres
 sional testimony\, “he gives up a certain amount of privacy.” Now the 
 bank’s ability to invade his privacy would be regulated and standardized
 \, with the result that a loan could be done in a national market. The Gat
 sby era ended.\nThere were two thousand credit [ https://substack.com/redi

 ke advantage and encourage network effects to exclude rivals. They use a 
 “give-to-get” rule\, meaning that a lender that wants credit informati
 on to determine whether to offer a loan has to give data on its customers 
 back to the credit bureaus in return for that information. The credit bure
 aus\, fostered by regulatory choices and consolidation\, were the first wa
 ve of big data firms\, laying the groundwork for corporations like Google 
 and Facebook years later.\nA different corporation\, applies an algorithm 
 to these credit bureau files to give each  consumer a specific score\, whi
 ch is known as a FICO score. Having one number for a credit risk simplifie
 d lending and borrowing\, especially as loans were split up into tranches 
 and sold to Wall Street in large portfolios. In the 1990s\, the government
 \, through its various housing finance programs and entities Fannie Mae an

 any ways\, FICO is the first artificial intelligence firm. \nBy the 2000s\

  market position\, however. So even Patrick McHenry\, the most favorable W
 all Street Republican\, criticized the bureaus. “There is no better exam
 ple than the oligopoly that was created than the three that are sitting be
 fore us here today\,” he said. “Our credit reporting system would be w
 ell-served by increased competition." \nThe monetary cost not levied on co
 nsumers is paid by the lenders\, employers\, government\, and other users 
 of credit reports and identity services. And since completing a mortgage l
 oan requires a FICO score from each one of the credit bureaus\, what is kn
 own as a ‘trimerge\,’ all three bureaus plus FICO have massive pricing
  power. FICO tends to lead the price increase\, hiking its algorithm cost\

  claim is that the four firms are now a cartel.\nContracts between FICO an
 d the bureaus create a set of reciprocal obligations. The contracts includ
 e a “no equivalent product” clause that prohibits a credit bureau from
  developing or distributing a non-FICO analytic. It also includes a “dyn
 amic royalty schedule” that allows FICO to charge seven times more if a 
 lender uses a non-FICO score. In return\, the bureaus all get the same pri
 ce from FICO through a ‘level playing field’ clause\, which means they
  know their costs are identical and so can coordinate pricing more easily.
  \nThe net effect is that FICO ends up coordinating pricing in the industr
 y. When FICO hikes prices\, so do the credit bureaus. Equifax CEO Begor sa

 t when FICO “put through a price increase . . . Equifax[\,] TU and Exper
 ian deliver[ed] that price increase to the marketplace\, when they increas
 e the price of their credit score. So that rolled through.”\nIt’s not 
 that hard to come up with a model for underwriting that is reasonably accu
 rate\; any bank with scale could probably do it. But FICO uses trade secre
 ts\, copyright\, patents\, or restrictive contracts to block anyone from d
 oing so. A contact in the industry sent me a sample contract\, which is fu
 ll of absurd restrictions on the ability to use FICO scores. \nFICO prohib
 its not only validating different models against FICO scores\, but even di
 splaying FICO scores next to non-FICO scores. All of these tactics are an 
 invitation to the Antitrust Division to investigate the industry\, which i
 t periodically has\, most recently in 2020 [ https://substack.com/redirect

 Vf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ]. \nAnd there’s another reason it’s imposs
 ible to move away from FICO - switching costs. FICO scores on top of a cre
 dit bureau file are baked into the operations of most banks and Wall Stree
 t buyers of mortgage bonds. One major lender\, for instance\, identified o
 ver 600 places it was using a FICO score in its business processes. Citiba
 nk undertook an 18 month operational review just to move to an updated FIC
 O score. And when investors buy mortgage-backed securities\, the FICO scor
 es of the loans are a key mechanism to figure out how to price them. Banks
  hate change and risk\, and a different credit scoring system introduces b
 oth.\nThe Mortgage Rebellion\nStill\, for the most part\, the credit burea
 us stayed off the radar\, because the cost of a score had been low compare
 d to the credit product. If you’re making a half a million dollar loan\,
  who cares if you have to shell out $10 for a credit pull?  The bureaus an
 d FICO sell to a broad range of customers\, including banking\, insurance\
 , retail\, healthcare and the government. A little bit of cost for each of
  them isn’t a big deal\, especially when they can pass those costs onwar
 d.\nBut recently\, that dynamic changed. In 2022\, FICO announced a series
  of what would become an aggregate 500% price increase for the mortgage in
 dustry over the next two years. The reason is likely that the firm’s CEO
 \, Will Lansing\, had [ https://substack.com/redirect/21a79d16-9629-419c-b

 023. And it worked\, Lansing was the fifth highest paid CEO in America tha
 t year. And though FICO claims it doesn’t set the overall price for cred
 it scores (though many in the industry are skeptical)\, its stock price re
 flected much higher margins. \nAnd a backlash began among their customers\
 , notably mortgage lenders. It’s a bad time to be a mortgage lender\, wi
 th high interest rates absolutely killing the mortgage market. \nA few yea
 rs ago\, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)\, which runs most housi
 ng finance for the government through its control of secondary mortgage bu
 yers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\, decided that it might want to create som
 e competition for FICO. So it turned to VantageScore. Only\, it got backla
 sh from Wall Street\, which didn’t want to bother changing their models 
 for mortgage backed securities.\nInstead of allowing mortgage lenders to p
 ick either FICO or VantageScore\, FHFA simply required that lenders use bo
 th. So now\, instead of having to deal with one monopoly\, mortgage lender
 s will have to deal with two\, buying two scores appended to different cre
 dit bureaus. That made [ https://substack.com/redirect/a7160975-979c-4402-

 re for this new regime\, but in reality simply because they could.\nThe pr
 ospect of having to buy more credit scores at a higher price\, all at a ti
 me when there are significantly fewer customers\, has sent mortgage banker
 s into a frenzy. If nothing is done\, mortgage bankers will have to ask cu
 stomers upfront to pay for their own credit scoring\, which will radically
  limit who can get a loan.\nThere are additional problems. When a mortgage

 that can be overcome. Chopra cited [ https://substack.com/redirect/2cadf91

 “to address price gouging in this market.” Chopra mentioned another au
 thority\, which is the ability that the CFPB has to force financial entiti
 es to let consumers port their financial information from one entity to an
 other. With a price cap and interoperability\, consumers could take their 
 credit score from one mortgage banker to another\, without those bankers h
 aving to pay for a new credit pull each time. \n(As an aside\, if you want
  to act on this problem\, the CFPB recently opened a public comment docket

 rice hikes. It should\, and that could encourage the firms to stop their a
 ggressive gouging. There are also private suits\; the current antitrust ca
 se against FICO is proceeding apace. In addition\, the FHFA could change i
 ts poor decision\, and allow mortgage lenders to pick either FICO or Vanta
 geScore\, which would foster price competition among them. That would requ
 ire some significant technical changes to how Fannie and Freddie package l
 oans\, but they can do that if they want. And then of course Congress coul
 d act\, and either pass explicit price caps in this particular area\, sinc
 e FICO is clearly a utility\, or force FICO to just let other entities use
  their algorithm so it faces competition.\nOne of the more interesting dyn
 amics in politics today is what happens when groups of business leaders co
 llectively realize they are being subjected to a coercive monopoly. They o
 ften look around and start seeing what others are facing as well. Today\, 
 that’s happening among mortgage bankers. What’s particularly interesti
 ng is that those HousingWire reporters\, who write about and are favorable
  to mortgage bankers\, actually started to notice other consumer harms tha
 t Chopra highlighted about credit reporting\, once they saw that consumers
  and bankers were in the same boat. \nIs there a broader lesson here? Well
 \, it’s that in a sense\, all of us who make money doing honest business
  or buying from honest businesses have an interest in the rule of law and 
 assertive regulators. It’s not a coincidence that the people most sympat
 hetic to the problems facing mortgage bankers is Rohit Chopra\, an anti-mo
 nopolist consumer protection regulator\, and Josh Hawley\, a populist Sena
 tor. After all\, who is the real threat to mortgage banking? The CFPB\, wh
 o is trying to control the costs that they have to pay\, and protect consu
 mers at the same time? Or FICO and the credit bureau cartel\, who are rais
 ing prices in the midst of collapsing demand?\nThat’s a lesson being re-
 learned\, in a broader sense\, not just by mortgage bankers today\, but by
  independent pharmacists\, grocery store owners\, farmers and ranchers\, a
 pp developers\, Hollywood producers\, doctors\, car repair shop owners\, a
 nd anyone seeing their livelihood squeezed by a coercive middleman. Eventu
 ally\, someone hits on either government regulation or antitrust\, and the
 n the conversations start. In the Declaration of Independence\, Thomas Jef
 ferson wrote that “governments are instituted” in order to “to secur
 e these rights” of “life\, liberty\, and the pursuit of happiness.”

SUMMARY:Blair and Starmer
DESCRIPTION:Tony Blair has become a deeply controversial and widely dislike
 d figure on the British Left for several key reasons:\n\n## Political Lega
 cy\n\nBlair's "New Labour" approach is seen by many on the Left as a betra
 yal of core Labour values:\n\n- He embraced neoliberal economic policies a
 nd moved the party to the center\, alienating traditional left-wing suppor
 ters[1].\n- His government pursued socially conservative policies on crime
 \, immigration\, and welfare that were often indistinguishable from Conser
 vative positions[2].\n- Blair is viewed as having continued Thatcherism ra
 ther than offering a true left-wing alternative[2].\n\n## Foreign Policy\n
 \nThe Iraq War is perhaps the single biggest source of animosity toward Bl
 air:\n\n- The 2016 Chilcot Report found that Blair exaggerated the threat 
 from Iraq to justify the invasion\, which has led to hundreds of thousands
  of deaths[2].\n- His support for US foreign policy and interventionism is
  seen as a betrayal of left-wing anti-war principles[3].\n\n## Post-Prime 
 Ministerial Activities\n\nBlair's actions since leaving office have furthe
 r damaged his reputation:\n\n- He has made millions through consulting wor
 k for authoritarian regimes and corporations[1].\n- He continues to offer 
 political commentary and criticism of the Left\, refusing to retire gracef
 ully[1].\n- His interventions are seen as undermining subsequent Labour le
 aders\, especially during Jeremy Corbyn's tenure[1].\n\n## Perceived Arrog
 ance and Lack of Contrition\n\nMany on the Left feel Blair has never prope
 rly acknowledged or apologized for his mistakes:\n\n- He remains unrepenta
 nt about the Iraq War and other controversial decisions[4].\n- His continu
 ed presence in public life is seen as tone-deaf given his unpopularity[6].
 \n\nIn essence\, Blair is viewed by much of the Left as having abandoned s
 ocialist principles\, led the country into an illegal war\, and then profi
 ted from his connections while refusing to admit wrongdoing. This combinat
 ion of factors has made him a uniquely reviled figure among many Labour su
 pporters and left-wing Britons.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://jacobin.com/202

SUMMARY:Putting off the evil day
DESCRIPTION:Quantitative Easing (QE) and Zero Interest Rate Policy (ZIRP) s
 uppress volatility in financial markets through several mechanisms:\n\n###
  1. **Lowering the Cost of Borrowing**\n   - **ZIRP**: By keeping interest
  rates near or at zero\, central banks make borrowing cheaper for banks\, 
 corporations\, and individuals. This encourages risk-taking and investment
  in higher-yielding assets. Low borrowing costs reduce stress on the finan
 cial system\, calming market participants and reducing volatility.\n   \n 
   - **QE**: Central banks purchase government bonds and other financial as
 sets\, injecting liquidity into the economy. This increased liquidity lowe
 rs yields (interest rates on bonds)\, making it cheaper for institutions t
 o finance their operations\, further supporting asset prices and suppressi
 ng volatility.\n\n### 2. **Asset Price Support**\n   - **QE**: By purchasi
 ng large amounts of government bonds and other securities\, central banks 
 push up the prices of these assets. Higher asset prices create a wealth ef
 fect\, making investors feel more secure and less likely to sell their hol
 dings\, reducing market fluctuations. The demand from central banks also c
 reates a backstop\, stabilizing markets and suppressing volatility.\n\n###
  3. **Reducing Risk Premiums**\n   - **ZIRP and QE**: With interest rates 
 at or near zero\, the returns on safer assets (like government bonds) are 
 low\, prompting investors to seek returns in riskier assets such as stocks
 \, corporate bonds\, or emerging market debt. This hunt for yield compress
 es risk premiums (the extra return investors demand for holding riskier as
 sets)\, contributing to less differentiation between safe and risky assets
 . This compresses volatility across the board\, as investors expect less v
 ariation in returns.\n\n### 4. **Moral Hazard and the "Central Bank Put"**
 \n   - Investors believe that central banks\, through ZIRP and QE\, will s
 tep in during times of crisis to support markets\, a concept known as the 
 "central bank put." This belief reduces the perceived risk of holding risk
 y assets\, leading to less selling pressure during downturns\, which in tu
 rn dampens market volatility. It creates a sense of stability\, though pot
 entially artificial\, in the markets.\n\n### 5. **Suppressing Economic Unc
 ertainty**\n   - Both policies aim to stabilize the broader economy by sti
 mulating spending\, investment\, and growth. By promoting economic stabili
 ty\, these policies help reduce the uncertainty that often causes market v
 olatility. Lower economic uncertainty leads to smoother market functioning
  and smaller swings in asset prices.\n\n### 6. **Reduction of Financial St
 ress**\n   - QE and ZIRP ease financial conditions by lowering interest ra
 tes\, improving liquidity\, and providing assurance to markets. This reduc
 es financial stress indicators (such as credit spreads) and stabilizes mar
 kets\, contributing to suppressed volatility.\n\nIn summary\, QE and ZIRP 
 suppress volatility by making borrowing cheaper\, pushing up asset prices\
 , reducing risk premiums\, and creating a perception of stability through 
 central bank intervention. However\, this suppression of volatility can ma
 sk underlying risks\, leading to fragility in the financial system.

SUMMARY:Good mission statements and real mission statements
DESCRIPTION:\nMilton Friedman said that companies only duty was to make mon
 ey for their shareholders. \nAll other stakeholders were to be rewarded\, 
 but only up to the limit set by their contractual entitlement and statutor
 y protections.\nShareholders have no contractual rights\, but take the res
 idual risk of a company failing\, \nso should be entitled to the totality 
 of the residual income (if any).\n\nNeoliberalism is deeply out of fashion
 .\nNo company wants to have as its mission statement "We aim to enrich our
  shareholders to the maximum extent permitted by law."\nSo\, instead\, com
 panies say things like \n\n- "We’re in business to save our home planet.
 "[^1]\n- "...\, and use business to inspire and implement solutions to the
  environmental crisis."[^2]\n- "To accelerate the world’s transition to 
 sustainable energy."[^3]\n- "To make sustainable living commonplace."[^4]\
 n- "Bringing health through food to as many people as possible."[^5]\n- 
 “building safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the be
 nefit of humanity”. [^6]\n\nActually\, companies have never said to thei
 r customers "Our mission is to make you pay as much as possible for what w
 e can make as cheaply as possible\,"\nbut they didn't make up stuff about 
 being in business to save the planet\, apart from a few in the environment
 al vanguard like the Body Shop.\n\nIt makes sense for companies to sustain
  the fiction that they only exist to save the planet:\n\n- it makes them m
 ore attractive as employers\, especially to the top graduates of top tier 
 universities\,\n- it makes people feel better about buying another tub of 
 ice cream\,\n- it makes CEO's feel better about themselves\, and gives the
 m something positive to talk about with the wives of other CEOs at dinner 
 parties\,\n- it pushes up their ESG ratings\, allowing their companies sec
 urities to qualify for inclusion in ESG funds\, potentially lowering their
  cost of capital\,\n- it differentiates them from their smaller\, more tra
 ditionally run competitors. \n\nThe problem is\, the planet isn't being sa
 ved\, or\, at least\, it's not at all clear that companies with these virt
 ue-signalling mission statements are very different from the rest.\n\nSeve
 ral companies have faced pressure to scale back or alter their Environment
 al\, Social\, and Governance (ESG) commitments due to various challenges\,
  including economic pressures\, political shifts\, and practical implement
 ation difficulties. Here are a few notable examples:\n\n1. **Unilever**:\n
    - Unilever\, known for its strong commitment to sustainability and ESG 
 principles\, faced investor pressure to prioritize financial performance o
 ver its ESG goals. In 2022\, some major shareholders expressed concerns th
 at the company was too focused on ESG initiatives at the expense of its co
 re business performance.\n\n2. **Danone**:\n   - Danone\, the French multi
 national food company\, experienced a backlash from investors over its ESG
  focus. In 2021\, CEO Emmanuel Faber was ousted following criticism that h
 is strong emphasis on social and environmental goals had led to poor finan
 cial performance and stagnating sales.\n\n3. **Shell**:\n   - Royal Dutch 
 Shell has faced legal and shareholder pressures regarding its environmenta
 l commitments. In 2021\, a Dutch court ordered Shell to cut its carbon emi
 ssions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2019 levels\, significantly impacting it
 s business strategy. Additionally\, some investors have pushed back agains
 t the company’s pace of transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n4. **HSBC*
 *:\n   - HSBC\, a major global bank\, announced a commitment to achieve ne
 t-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However\, the bank faced criticism for co
 ntinuing to finance fossil fuel projects. In response to pressure from bot
 h environmental groups and investors\, HSBC has had to navigate the balanc
 e between maintaining its ESG commitments and its business interests in th
 e energy sector.\n\n5. **BlackRock**:\n   - BlackRock\, the world's larges
 t asset manager\, has been vocal about incorporating ESG into its investme
 nt strategies. However\, the company has faced scrutiny and criticism for 
 its investments in fossil fuels and other industries that are considered e
 nvironmentally detrimental. This has led to a perception that the firm’s
  actions do not always align with its ESG rhetoric.\n\n6. **H&M**:\n   - T
 he Swedish multinational clothing retailer H&M has committed to various su
 stainability initiatives\, including using more sustainable materials. How
 ever\, the company has faced criticism and legal challenges regarding labo
 r practices in its supply chain\, leading to questions about its overall E
 SG commitments and the balance between environmental and social goals.\n\n
 These examples illustrate the complexities and challenges companies face i
 n maintaining and balancing their ESG commitments with financial performan
 ce and stakeholder expectations.\n\n[^1]: Patagonia\, a maker of expensive
  gilets.\n[^2]: Ben and Jerry's\, a maker of expensive ice cream.\n[^3]: T
 esla\, a maker of expensive motor cars.\n[^4]: Unilever\, a maker of mayon
 naise and laundry detergent.\n[^5]: Danone\, a supplier of yoghourt to the
  masses\, and a vital part of France's defence capability.\n[^6]: Open AI\
 , which isn't open (source)\, has become\, _de facto_ the AI division of M
 icrosoft ("To empower every person and every organization on the planet to
  achieve more.")\n

SUMMARY:Spruce Point Capital Management Will Release A Unique And Special N
 ew Investigative Report Tomorrow
DESCRIPTION:We are pleased to announce the release of a new and unique fore
 nsic investigative short-selling report tomorrow\, May 8th on our website 
 www.sprucepointcap.com ( {emailLinkId=556} https://www.sprucepointcap.com/
  ).\n\n**For those who missed our short report on Nuvei ( {emailLinkId=557
 } https://www.sprucepointcap.com/research/nuvei-corp ) (TSX / Nasdaq: NVEI
 )\, a stock that has since declined by as much as 83% and taken private at
  a vastly reduced valuation\, there are important lessons to be learned.**
  When we exposed the shady business and dealings of Nuvei\, we stressed he
 avily our concerns about management\, and in particular the CEO\, who we f
 ound to have made questionable claims about his education. We also pointed
  out that two executives\, including the CFO\, failed to disclose on their
  biographies stints at another public company that settled a non-prosecuti
 on agreement with the Department of Justice. We even doubled down on our s
 hort against Nuvei with a second report after its promotional event with H
 ollywood celebrity Ryan Reynolds ( {emailLinkId=558} https://www.bloomberg
 .com/news/videos/2023-04-18/ryan-reynolds-on-fintech-investing-soccer-soci
 al-media-video ). We believe the lessons to be learned from this case stud
 y in short-selling are clear: sell fast when the CEO is not transparent ab
 out his education\, when executives omit problematic roles from their biog
 raphies\, and when companies depend on celebrities to generate hype around
  their stock.\n\n**Tomorrow we will expose a Company that has what we beli
 eve is some of the worst management and board governance we've ever seen f
 or a multibillion dollar public company.** We will express concerns about 
 the CEO's education claims\, and also the fact that he has omitted a posit
 ion from his biography over two decades ago that we believe is highly inst
 ructive in gaining insights to his current managerial behavior and relatio
 nships. But our issue with the CEO is only the tip of the iceberg. **We we
 re stunned to uncover that at least five executives and Board members of t
 he Company are associated with an eye-opening seven public companies that 
 had financial restatements.** We will lay out the case why we believe the 
 Company's business strategy is so flawed that even Warren Buffet and Berks
 hire Hathaway\, which has a $190 billion dollar war chest at their disposa
 l and who knows the business and industry\, isn't choosing to follow the C
 ompany's strategy. We think it is because the business model is under more
  pressure than the promoters and management are leading investors to belie
 ve. Furthermore\, given the executives' past associations with financial r
 estatements\, and anomalies we have recently identified with the Company's
  reporting\, we believe the risk of financial misstatement is extremely hi
 gh. Not surprisingly\, there is no Clawback Policy in place in the event o
 f fraud or misstatement\, and the promotional Company has managed to tethe
 r itself to celebrities to juice the stock to near all-time highs\, making
  the set-up for disappointment increasingly likely.\n\nThe full report can
  be downloaded tomorrow at www.sprucepointcap.com ( {emailLinkId=559} http
 s://www.sprucepointcap.com/ ).\n\nThe recommendations listed above are not
  intended to be exhaustive or represent investment returns following Spruc

SUMMARY:Subsidizing our way to net zero
DESCRIPTION:https://www.ft.com/content/87393499-41da-403a-8823-bd31e910138e
 \n\n\n	Heat pump sales across Europe fell by 47 per cent in the first half
  of the year as consumers lost enthusiasm for switching away from gas boil
 ers\, putting more pressure on the EU’s green agenda.\n\nIn the first si
 x months of 2024\, just 765\,000 heat pumps were sold across the 13 big Eu
 ropean countries\, including France\, Italy\, Germany and Sweden\, which c
 ollectively account for 80 per cent of the market\, according to the Europ
 ean Heat Pump Association (EHPA).\n\nSales fell from 1.44mn in the same pe
 riod last year\, as fewer subsidies and lower gas prices lessened the ince
 ntive for households to switch away from gas boilers\, the EHPA added.\n\n
 Under plans published in 2022 after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukra
 ine drove up the price of fossil fuels\, the EU set a goal of installing a
 t least 10mn more heat pumps by 2027.\n\nHeat pumps heat or cool buildings
  by using electricity to transfer heat to and from the outside ground or a
 ir. They are widely seen as a solution to decarbonising household heating\
 , when powered by renewable energy\, but their adoption has been hampered 
 by cost\, a lack of qualified installers and wavering government subsidy s
 chemes.\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:Religion as a parasite
DESCRIPTION:Parasites evolve to be less and less harmful to their hosts. So
 me transition into symbiotic elements: e.g. mitochondria.\n\nMaybe make th
 is post more wide-ranging as you bring in some ideas from Divine Economy. 
 \n\nMost religions that have ever existed are gone and forgotten.\n\nClose
  links with politics. \n\nCompetitive environment.\n\nGradual substitution
  of immanent religions (Ancient Greek) with transcendental ones (Christian
 ity).\n\nReligion has to deliver benefits. Creating a community is possibl
 y the biggest one.\n\nfrom perplexity:\n\nThe Evolution of Religion: From 
 Parasitism to Symbiosis\n\nThroughout human history\, religions have playe
 d a crucial role in shaping societies\, cultures\, and individual lives. H
 owever\, the religious landscape has been far from static. Like biological
  organisms\, religions have undergone a process of evolution\, with some t
 hriving and others fading into obscurity. This evolutionary journey of rel
 igion offers fascinating insights into the dynamics of cultural adaptation
  and the symbiotic relationship between belief systems and their host soci
 eties.\n\n## The Parasitic Origins of Religion\n\nIn its early stages\, re
 ligion often exhibited parasitic characteristics. Primitive belief systems
  frequently demanded costly sacrifices\, imposed burdensome rituals\, and 
 sometimes even called for human offerings. These practices\, while detrime
 ntal to individuals and societies\, persisted due to the fear and supersti
 tion they instilled. Early religions exploited human psychology\, leveragi
 ng our innate tendencies towards pattern-seeking and agency detection to c
 reate explanations for natural phenomena and life's uncertainties[1].\n\n#
 # The Competitive Religious Landscape\n\nAs human societies grew more comp
 lex\, so did their religious beliefs. This led to a highly competitive env
 ironment where different religions vied for followers and influence. Much 
 like biological evolution\, this competition drove rapid changes and adapt
 ations in religious doctrines and practices. Religions that failed to attr
 act adherents or provide tangible benefits to their host societies often d
 ied out\, explaining why most religions that have ever existed are now gon
 e and forgotten[2].\n\n## The Symbiotic Shift\n\nOver time\, successful re
 ligions evolved to become more symbiotic with their host societies. This t
 ransition mirrors the evolutionary journey of mitochondria\, which began a
 s independent organisms but eventually became essential components of euka
 ryotic cells. Similarly\, religions that survived and thrived were those t
 hat offered significant benefits to their adherents and the broader commun
 ity[3].\n\nOne of the most crucial benefits provided by religion is the cr
 eation of community. Religious institutions offer a sense of belonging\, s
 ocial support networks\, and shared moral frameworks. This community-build
 ing aspect has been a key factor in the longevity of many major world reli
 gions[4].\n\n## The Shift from Immanent to Transcendental Religions\n\nAno
 ther notable trend in religious evolution has been the gradual substitutio
 n of immanent religions with transcendental ones. Ancient Greek religion\,
  for example\, viewed gods as immanent forces within nature. In contrast\,
  Christianity introduced a transcendent God existing beyond the physical w
 orld. This shift allowed for more abstract and flexible belief systems tha
 t could adapt to changing societal needs and scientific understanding[5].\
 n\n## Religion and Politics: A Complex Symbiosis\n\nThe evolution of relig
 ion has been closely intertwined with political power structures. Througho
 ut history\, religious institutions have often formed symbiotic relationsh
 ips with ruling elites\, providing legitimacy to political authority in ex
 change for protection and support. This relationship has shaped the develo
 pment of both religious doctrines and political systems[6].\n\nHowever\, t
 his symbiosis has not always been stable. When religious institutions beca
 me too closely aligned with unpopular regimes or failed to adapt to changi
 ng social values\, they risked losing their influence. The Protestant Refo
 rmation\, for instance\, can be seen as a response to the perceived corrup
 tion and rigidity of the Catholic Church[7].\n\n## Modern Adaptations\n\nI
 n the contemporary world\, religions continue to evolve in response to soc
 ietal changes. Many religious institutions have adapted their teachings to
  accommodate scientific discoveries\, changing social norms\, and the chal
 lenges of globalization. For instance\, some branches of Christianity have
  reinterpreted biblical texts to be more inclusive of LGBTQ+ individuals\,
  while others have incorporated environmental stewardship into their doctr
 ines[8].\n\n## The Future of Religious Evolution\n\nAs we look to the futu
 re\, it's clear that religions will continue to evolve. The rise of secula
 rism in many parts of the world presents a new selective pressure\, pushin
 g religions to find new ways to remain relevant. Some scholars predict a c
 ontinued trend towards more personal\, individualized forms of spiritualit
 y\, while others foresee a resurgence of traditional religious practices i
 n response to the uncertainties of modern life.\n\nIn conclusion\, the evo
 lution of religion from parasitic beginnings to symbiotic relationships wi
 th host societies offers a compelling lens through which to view human cul
 tural development. By providing community\, meaning\, and moral frameworks
 \, successful religions have become integral parts of human societies\, mu
 ch like mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. As we face new challenges in the
  21st century\, it will be fascinating to observe how religions continue t
 o adapt and evolve in response to changing human needs and understanding.\

SUMMARY:The problem of asking and of safety
DESCRIPTION:The world is not black and white. Risks are not easily quantifi
 able. The decision to take a risk cannot be outsourced. Maybe\, this is th
 e essence of the distinction between risk and uncertainty that Frank Knigh
 t wrote about so inscrutably.\n\nBasically\, if you ask a lawyer "should I
  take this risk"\, he'll say "No!"\, even if the expected loss is a lot le
 ss than the expected gain.\n\nIn science\, some problems can be solved ent
 irely from first principles. However\, many experimental results cannot be
  related directly back to first principles\, but can be explained by a sor
 t of half-way house\, a model which is consistent with first principles\, 
 but not directly derived from it. In physics\, this would be described a p
 henomenological model. In other sciences\, there is no equivalent word\, b
 ecause it vanishingly rare to make a quantitative prediction directly from
  first principles anywhere but physics.\n\nA lot of important political is
 sues revolve around estimating risk. The obviously big one is climate chan
 ge. But many regulations\, for example drug safety\, water cleanliness\, s
 eatbelts\, car design\, child protection\, also revolve around risk.\n\nOu
 r instinct\, derived from out attitude to members of our family\, is to ru
 le any risk of death as unacceptable. If there is any possibility that som
 e action we take will result in the death of one of our children\, we'll b
 e careful to avoiding taking it.\n\nEven in the family\, this is irrationa
 l. If we spend another £10K on a big modern car\, on the basis that it's 
 slightly safer than our old banger (maybe it has LIDAR)\, this is money th
 at we cannot spend on vitamin suplement At the government level\, this app
 lies with a million times more. If the UK gets a shy new High Speed train\
 , this might save the planet (a tiny bit)\, but the resoures spent on the 
 capital an labour elements of this project

SUMMARY:Choosing the Right Counterparty
DESCRIPTION:Basically\, some companies exist to find patsies. \n\n- $HLF\,\
 n- Goldman Sachs\,\n- Nigerian scammers\,\n- FTX\,\n- most of crypto\,\n- 
 lottery companies\,\n- tobacco companies\,\n- most of the luxury sector.\n
 \nIt's not necessarily a bad business to be in. Some of it outright fraud\
 , but some of it is providing a product or service that people\, if they h
 ad more knowledge or imagination\, or analytical ability would avoid. \n\n
 Bring in something about Veblen and conspicuous consumption.\n\nMention so
 mething about how scammers are much more prevalent now because:\n\n- it's 
 much more easy to locate easy 'marks'\,\n- it's much easier disappear into
  the crowd\, now\, because the crowd is so much bigger.\n\n\n----------\n
 “**Know someone who might like Capital Gains?** Use the referral program
  to gain access to my database of book reviews (1)\, an invite to the Capi
 tal Gains Discord (2)\, stickers (10)\, and a mug (25). Find your referral
  link at the bottom!“ — \n\n\n----------Investing\, and business gener
 ally\, is a game of relative advantage. There are two ways to get that: on
 e is to try to maximize some kind of absolute advantage—design the faste
 st GPU\, build the most comprehensive distribution network\, estimate the 
 intrinsic value of an investment with maximum accuracy\, etc. But sometime
 s the right move is to just find a place where your median competitor is n
 ot as bright or hardworking as you are.\n\nFinance has cycles and epicycle
 s of this. Some investors do well in one kind of investing until their ret
 urns attract competition\, at which point they need to broaden their manda
 te. This can work very well (Soros moving out of arbitrage\, Buffett aband
 oning "cigar butt" microcaps)\, but it's also tricky—there's a lot more 
 competition in [TMT](https://capitalgains.thediff.co/p/tmt) than there was
  a decade ago\, so some TMT investors have broadened their mandate to look
  at companies that have similar economic dynamics\, but aren't really tech
  (in the related posts section at the end\, we link to a writeup of a pota
 to company popular with tech funds). And while this gives them a way to be
 t on the other 90% of the economy\, it also means that they're looking at 
 companies with a different margin of error: non-tech is more forgiving of 
 strategic mistakes but less so of operational ones.^1^ Alternatively\, ins
 tead of going non-tech\, some investors will take an approach that works i
 n one geography and apply it somewhere else\, trying to back the [successf
 ul American startup] of [a country other than America]. It’s true that t
 hey're competing in a less efficient market\, but that also means they're 
 competing in a market with a different class of problems: the same competi
 tion for talent that makes the Bay Area an expensive place to operate also
  makes it a place where\, if you need someone with N years of experience u
 sing technology X\, you can find them fast.\n\nSome businesses are structu
 red almost entirely as a search for an uninformed counterparty. The bet a 
 search fund is making\, for example\, is that the fund manager knows more 
 about business operations and (especially) financial engineering than the 
 founder-owner of whatever company they're buying\, and that this knowledge
  offsets the founder-owner's relatively more sophisticated understanding o
 f the exact business they're in. Sometimes\, this works well\, and sometim
 es it means you bought Bob Inc.\, Bob retired\, and all the revenue came f
 rom customers who personally liked Bob but will now go somewhere else.\n\n
 At the other end of the speed/scale spectrum\, market-makers always have t
 o think carefully about who is on the other side of the trade\, and what t
 hat counterparty knows. One way they can somewhat avoid this is payment fo
 r order flow\, i.e. paying Robinhood or another broker to direct orders to
  them\, giving the Robinhood customers better prices\, and trading with co
 nfidence since they know that Robinhood's customers are doing some combina
 tion of investing modest savings and gambling\, and will not be placing hu
 ge orders.^2^\n\nAn intermediate version of this is when someone works for
  a while in a highly-scalable\, highly-competitive field and then tries to
  apply this to a less-scalable\, but less competitive one. Examples abound
 :\n\n* Sometimes entrepreneurs will succeed in a software business and the
 n launch a software-enabled brick-and-mortar company\, like Spiffy\, the c
 ar wash business co-founded by someone who'd previously built the e-commer
 ce software company ChannelAdvisor\, or Column\, a bank run by a cofounder
  of Plaid.\n\n* Some systematic investors in equities\, bonds\, and FX app
 lied their skills to crypto\, where the market was far less efficient and 
 the opportunities were easier to spot. But this was also a different world
 \, one in which counterparty risk matters more and the regulatory situatio
 n is uncertain. Crypto is one of those places where your "alpha" might jus
 t be the risk premium you're paid for running a strategy on exchanges that
  are not long for this world.\n\n* Discretionary investors will sometimes 
 downshift from analyzing mid- and large-cap stocks at a hedge fund to trad
 ing small-caps with their personal money. This is actually a lot like the 
 search fund business. If you find an undervalued local bank with a $50m ma
 rket cap\, you don't have to worry about a Citadel or Millennium analyst h
 aving gotten there first. On the other hand\, you _are_ competing with the
  guy who plays golf with the chairman every week and has never heard the t
 erm "Material Nonpublic Information." You're also competing with locals wh
 o know whether or not the loan officer does favors for friends\, and who w
 ill notice if Chase starts building a branch.\n\nThis may be worth it! In 
 fact\, the general path of starting in a competitive and scalable field\, 
 applying the gains to a less competitive and less scalable field\, and the
 n growing back to where you were before (or past it!) with a lot more of y
 our own capital is well-established. That's basically what Buffett did\; h
 e worked for Benjamin Graham for a while\, then raised his own fund with a
 n order of magnitude less capital\, and put his personal money into even s
 maller opportunities than that. Looking for the poker table full of patsie
 s is a good way to optimize for percentage returns over dollar returns\, b
 ut if it works well enough\, the only tables with meaningful stakes will b
 e the one where other players know what they're doing.\n\n—————

 or error on the implementation side.\n\n2. Payment for order flow definite
 ly sounds more suspicious than it is\, but the important thing to know is 
 that to the extent that it involves exploitation\, the exploited party is 
 whatever hedge fund is paying more to trade with the market-makers than Ro
 binhood is. Typically\, the market-maker operates on a fast enough timesca
 le that they aren't worried that\, for example\, Bill Ackman is buying som
 ething from them at $100 that will be worth $130 next year. What they're w
 orried about instead is that Ackman is buying so much that the price will 
 be $101 later that day. If you are a customer whose order flow is worth pa
 ying for\, it's strictly better that somebody pay for it. It's best\, of c
 ourse\, not to be that customer\, especially if you look like one on paper

SUMMARY:Write a blog about how actual private enterprise is shrivelling
DESCRIPTION:This was triggered by yet another email from some clueless func
 tionary employed by a housing association (Southern Housing). I asked Clau
 de if their employees were classified as being in the private sector. This
  is what it said:\n\nHousing associations in the UK are classified as part
  of the private sector\, not the public sector.\nHousing associations are 
 independent\, non-profit organizations that provide low-cost social housin
 g. While they receive some public funding and work closely with local auth
 orities and the government's housing agencies\, they are still considered 
 private bodies.\nThe key reasons housing association employees are seen as
  private sector workers are:\n\nHousing associations are private companies
 \, not part of the state machinery or civil service.\nThey are non-profit 
 organizations\, but operate independently from direct government control.\
 nTheir staff are not crown employees or civil servants employed by the sta
 te.\nTheir employment terms and conditions are set by the housing associat
 ion itself\, not public sector pay scales.\n\nSo in summary\, despite thei
 r social purpose and some public funding\, housing association staff have 
 employment status as private sector workers in the UK rather than being cl
 assified as public sector employees.

SUMMARY:We are all Perónists now
DESCRIPTION:Peronism is a political movement which is devoid of any ideolog
 y. It does not represent the poor (although it promises lots of goodies to
  make their lives better)\, or the party of the rich (although they won't 
 suffer). It's not solely a nationalist party\, promising to spend more on 
 defence and on strenghening borders. It's all of the above\, and therefore
  none.\n\nIt needs a personality to form a cult around. Originally\, it wa
 s Eva Perón. Subsequently\, it was a variety of larger-than-life characte
 rs. But now it's everywhere. The Conservatives under Boris Johnson was Per
 ónist. The Labour Party is devoid of ideology\, it's true\, but Starmer j
 ust doesn't have what it takes to make the the movement truly Perónist. M
 aybe the flame-haired one\, Angela Rayner\, can play the part of Evita\, l
 eading the party to victory.\n\nThe old way of doing politics\, where part
 ies represent a particular factor of production: labour\, land\, capital\,
  doesn't really work any more. Labour is too fragmented and disorganized\,
  but nobody will vote for capitlalists\, or even less landowners. So we ha
 ve parties that don't want to offend voters\, or donors. \n\nAs long as th
 e media play ball\, this all works. But it's hard to control social media.
  China has done it\, the UK is trying hard\, and may well do it soon. The 
 Orwellian-titled "Online Safety Act" is coming in\, which will suppress "d
 isinformation"\, in other words\, information which is unhelpful to those 
 in power.\n\nposted to substack on 8 Oct 2024.

SUMMARY:Second Wave or Bump in the Road?
DESCRIPTION:View this post on the web at https://www.nexteconomy.co/p/secon
 d-wave-or-bump-in-the-road\n\nFor many market participants\, this week’s
  US inflation data is regarded as a crucial gateway to interest rate cuts 
 later this year. It is widely expected to come in soft\, allowing the Fed 
 to reduce interest rates over the summer months\, as per its previously co
 mmunicated guidance\nCuriously\, at the same time\, financial markets over
  the past weeks have been increasingly shaped by a “monetary debasement 
 bid”\, where real assets are aggressively bid in a presumably valuation 
 indifferent way\nAs an example\, the price of gold (a low volatility asset
 ) appreciated ~5% in April alone\, even as interest rates rose across the 
 curve. In other words\, investors preferred to own gold\, which pays nothi
 ng\, over cash US Dollars\, even though the reward on the latter improved.
  A highly unusual dynamic last seen at scale during the 1970s. This only m
 akes sense if one expects the purchasing power of said US dollars to decli
 ne significantly \nSo which one is right? The many forecasters who see inf
 lation as about to be retired to recent financial history given likely nea
 r-term softness. Or financial markets with their monetary debasement bid?\
 nNow\, I have no way of predicting this week’s CPI and PPI prints which\
 , like most government data\, contain a large element of randomness (thoug
 h I do note that March inflation swaps have trended up recently\, likely d
 ue to higher gasoline prices). But I would agree that the market has reaso
 ns to be concerned about resurging inflation risks. Here is why:\nLarge pa
 rt of the sharp inflation decline of the past 6 months was owed to the goo
 ds economy\, with services still sticky at an uncomfortably high level. De
 stocking and a depressed China did much of the work here. In fact\, with l
 ong leads\, goods pricing is likely to continue to be weak for a few more 
 months \nYes\, this is today\, but the market is forward looking. And what
  does it see? It sees global manufacturing now expanding for the first tim
 e since 2022\, e.g. as measured by the ISM Manufacturing survey\nWhile sur
 veys always come with all sorts of drawbacks\, given the ISM matches with 
 other important variables such as the swing in US-retailer inventories as 
 well as expanding electricity consumption in China\, I take it as a good p
 roxy for the global goods economy\nUnsurprisingly\, commodities have start
 ed to move\, too. But there is more to it. While the improving goods econo
 my cycle gives investors reason to buy them\,  the real motivation comes f
 rom elsewhere\nWhat is that? Simple - Jerome Powell gave a very dovish pre
 ss conference a few weeks ago that point-blank dismissed any inflation ris
 ks. While he may be lucky and right\, as I wrote at the time [ https://sub
 stack.com/redirect/5628aa0a-bce4-453b-8173-7d109df89e2f?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9
 .oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ]\, in my view it wasn’t go
 od Central Bank policy. The risk of resurgence definitely exists\, dismiss
 ing it is not credible and in fact increases exactly said risk\nWhy? Becau
 se credibility is the highest good for a Central Bank. If it is weak\, inv
 estors worry about the value of their money\, and seek protection. It is n
 o surprise that the “monetary debasement bid” started the moment Powel
 l ended the press conference\nMany market participants had a different vie
 w on inflation risks\, whether right or wrong. But by ignoring the risks e
 ntirely\, Powell gave them the reason to pull the trigger on protecting ag
 ainst them \nSo what did they buy this time around? Gold and commodities. 
 This is how inflation in face of a dovish Central Bank can become a self-f
 ulfilling prophecy. Rising commodity prices feed directly into higher infl
 ation expectations\, which investors protect against by buying exactly sai
 d assets - a circular reference of higher prices\nWe see this statement in
  financial markets data. Here is a chart of the 5-year US inflation expect
 ations. It has steadily increased since the Fed’s pivot in November ‘2
 3. Put this on top of your screen and follow it closely\nNow\, there are a
 lso many signs that the US economy is slowing (e.g. weak retail trends\, s
 lowing wage growth as per Indeed [ https://substack.com/redirect/1d002da9-
 5b67-422f-a130-10db7c553bf4?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j
 2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ])\, but this post-Covid cycle remains unusual. In other 
 words\, the goods economy (1/6th of GDP) can recover while services (5/6th
  of GDP) slow down. Which means that inflation can - at the very least tem
 porarily - pick up into weaker economic growth\, just as inflation slowed 
 in H2 ‘23 into torrid economic growth\nMy view is that commodities will 
 remain bid until either this nascent global industrial recovery falters\, 
 or the Fed leans hawkish again. As long as they are bid\, the market will 
 likely continue its monetary debasement narrative\, no matter what near-te
 rm CPI prints say\, as the market likely looks through them\nThis bid also
  extends to house prices\, and eventually rents. Redfin data [ https://sub
 stack.com/redirect/43e5f157-16f5-4be9-805e-cf9cbc51fcca?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9
 .oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] shows house prices are up 6
 .6% y-o-y\, the most since September ‘22. It seems unlikely to me that t
 his doesn’t eventually translate into rents \nWhat does that mean in the
  near term? Let’s say the CPI print comes in on the low side and short-t
 erm yields decline in expectation of the now more likely Fed cuts. In resp
 onse to this easier money\, commodities would be bid more\, leading in tur
 n to higher long-term yield and a steeper yield curve \nSummary:\nNear-ter
 m inflation may continue to slow\, with possibly weak CPI/PPI prints ahead
 \nHowever\, financial markets are already looking past that. With the indu
 strial complex in expansion for the first time since 2022\, commodities ha
 ve caught a bid\, substantially aided by worries around monetary debasemen
 t \nAbsent a less-likely u-turn in global manufacturing\, these self-fulfi
 lling inflationary pressures likely continue until the Fed acknowledges th
 em\nThe interesting part comes when/if the market realises that amidst fis
 cal dominance the Fed can in fact not do much\, even if it wanted to\, as 
 higher rates likely add more private sector income than they slow the econ
 omy\, with only the Treasury able to make a true difference. But this real
 isation\, which would sharply accelerate the bid into real assets\, is per
 haps still some time away  \nWhat does this mean for markets?\nThe followi
 ng section is for professional investors only. It reflects my own views in
  a strictly personal capacity and is shared with other likeminded investor
 s for the exchange of views and informational purposes only. Please see th
 e disclaimer at the bottom for more details and always note\, I may be ent
 irely wrong and/or may change my mind at any time. This is not investment 
 advice\, please do your own due diligence\nIn my last post\, I highlighted
  gold\, gold miners\, the commodity index\, Tesla and the Swiss Franc:\nWh
 ile gold\, the commodity index and especially gold miners caught a strong 
 bid\, the Swiss Franc has leaked lower (I am stopped out) and Tesla has ch
 opped sideways as excitement over FSD 12.3 is kept in check by very poor n
 ear term sales. I don’t know which one will win near-term\nStaying with 
 the theme of slower EV sales\, in addition to an improving industrial cycl
 e as well as investor preference for monetary debasement hedges\, I see Pl
 atinum and Palladium as attractive (see Le Shrub’s great write up on the
  topic here [ https://substack.com/redirect/62bca512-a3c6-4238-baba-30174e
 214a2d?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ]). 
 A likely higher near-term hybrid penetration means more automotive demand 
 for these metals relative to recent expectations\, while demand for other 
 industrial use cases improves and Platinum as the world’s rarest preciou
 s metal benefits from the gold-like monetary hedge. It has massively lagge
 d vs gold\, as per the platinum-gold ratio chart below from Shrub’s post
 . Rather than buying the metal itself\, I’ve bought a small position in 
 PGM producer Sibanye Stillwater. It is down 80% from highs\, highly levere
 d and provides an asymetric risk-return profile to higher PGM prices. (Ple
 ase always do your own due diligence and use stops!)\nOn a more general no
 te\, inflation caused by money printing (e.g. within a high deficit) is us
 ually good for equities as the value of real assets rises vs paper money\n
 This is different if there is a Central Bank fighting it\, or if inflation
  is due to supply shocks (oil embargo etc). Money printing of course invit
 es supply shocks caused by bad geopolitical actors. So as long as the Fed 
 stays dovish and there is no big escalation in the Middle East\, from the 
 inflation side there is not much worries for stocks  \nHowever\, there is 
 also liquidity. As mentioned in recent posts [ https://substack.com/redire
 ct/7677d1ff-ce4b-403d-b766-23c2838fbad5?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDv
 VXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ]\, I see the latter as headwind over Q2\, as
  a net-negative bill issuance drains liquidity for the private sector\, th
 us I am keeping exposure light until that changes \nFor that\, I have a ke
 en eye on the 1st May QRA\, which could still show low bill issuance as I 
 suspect that the tax intake comes in better than expected. However\, from 
 the summer I’d assume a return of the liquidity firehose and another big
  ramp in asset prices \nShould bonds rally on weak CPI/PPI data\, I would 
 fade that move\, especially as long as the commodity complex remains bid\n
 Finally\, as the market is a never ending sequence of narratives\, a new o
 ne surely isn’t too far away. Perhaps next ahead is again the story of a
 n economic slowdown due to higher long-end yields and higher input prices\
 , and then higher bill issuance as well as Fed cuts to help growth pick up
  again (to be clear\, not imminent\, but perhaps next…) \nThank you for

SUMMARY:School vouchers
DESCRIPTION:https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-school-vouchers-esa-
 private-schools\n\nI grew up reading Milton Friedman. \nNow I am older\, I
  can see that some of his brilliantly simple solutions to intractably comp
 lex problems may not work as expected. \n\nOne issue is school choice. Mil
 ton advocated for the use of vouchers. Parents would be able to get their 
 kids educated anywhere. Bad schools would lose income and would close down
 . Good ones would grow. Schooling would still be free\, but incompetent he
 ads and teachers would be eliminated.\n\nWell\, apparently\, it doesn't wo
 rk so well: Propublica has a piece\, [here](https://www.propublica.org/art
 icle/arizona-school-vouchers-esa-private-schools) about the problem\, whic
 h is that poor parents can't afford the transport costs to get their kids 
 to the best schools\, which tend to be in the posh neighbourhoods.\n\nA le
 ss radical proposal was to select kids by ballot\, when a school is over-s
 ubscribed. (In the UK\, at the end of primary school\, you can choose mayb
 e three local schools you'd like to send you kid to\, and rank them in ord

 icants\, use a ballot to choose a subset. This was ruled illegal\, by Ed B
 alls\, education minister at the time.\n\nAlastair Campbell\, a big beat L
 abour figure\, argued that choice was all wrong. The solution was to make 
 every school excellent. Somehow\, this seems an accepted argument\, even t
 hough it makes no sense to me.\n\nGood schools make a big difference. I go
 t lucky. Most do not. It's a great pity that the school system is terrible

SUMMARY:Martin Gurri - prophet of doom
DESCRIPTION:A lot of content you read is about how polarized Substack is\, 
 and how the mainstream media is toast.\n\nThere are a couple of Capitalisn
 't episodes about the Google advertising monopoly case\, which shows how G
 oogle has largely swallowed a whole industry\, which kept the mainsteam me
 dia alive.\n\n[This idea needs work.] Maybe\, the problem is something to 
 do with the idea that (e.g.) newspapers simply wanted to appeal to as broa
 d an audience as possible\, and so naturally avoided alienating any reader
 s. They may have had political axes to grind (or their owners did)\, but i
 t was done subliminally\, to the extent that large numbers of readers of t
 he Daily Mirror still voted Conservative.\n\nGurri posits that the problem
  that arose with the Internet was that the political leadership lost contr
 ol of how the population got their information. Maybe they were deluding t
 hemselves\, and that the MSM was pretending to suppress the fringe\, simpl
 y because it would reduce their advertising revenue.\n\nWrite something ab
 out what sort of equilibrium can be expected in a world in which there is 
 an unbounded number of content producers\, but a monopoly gatekeeper to so
 urces of advertising revenue.

DESCRIPTION:As humans\, we shy away from discussing tough topics.\n\n- Bide
 n's incapacity\,\n- The projections for the deficit (or PSBR\, as it used 
 to be called)\,\n- the fact that training is not a substitute for native i
 ntelligence\,\n- the fact that we might earn more than the person we meet 
 at a dinner party\,\n- anything to do with status\, really\, outside of ve
 ry private conversations\,\n- the fact that a lot of businesses rely on id
 entifying customers who are very bad at judging value for money and then s
 elling them stuff they don't need.\n - in a properly democratic system\, 5
 1% of the population should vote themselves 100% of the money. Politicians
  don't like what would likely follow from such an election and suppress pa
 rties that tend towards offering this policy. It's not sustainable. Democr
 acy itself is not sustainable\, without some sort of dishonesty from polit
 icians.\n\n\nFrom Claude:\n\n> Here are some examples of businesses that s
 ell potentially harmful products or rely heavily on advertising:\n> \n> To
 bacco companies - Their products are known to cause serious health issues.
 \n> Fast food chains - Often sell high-calorie\, low-nutrient foods that c
 an contribute to obesity and health problems.\n> Alcohol brands - Excessiv
 e alcohol consumption can lead to various health and social issues.\n> Gam
 bling establishments - Can lead to addiction and financial problems for so
 me individuals.\n> Sugary beverage manufacturers - Contribute to obesity\,
  diabetes\, and dental issues.\n> Tanning salons - Exposure to UV rays inc
 reases skin cancer risk.\n> Payday loan companies - Often target vulnerabl
 e individuals with high-interest loans.\n> Multilevel marketing (MLM) comp
 anies - Many rely on aggressive marketing tactics and can lead to financia
 l losses for participants.\n> Some pharmaceutical companies - May aggressi
 vely market drugs with potential side effects or questionable efficacy.\n>
  Bottled water companies - Often market a product that's not significantly
  different from tap water in many areas.\n> Fashion brands promoting "fast
  fashion" - Can encourage overconsumption and waste.\n> Certain beauty pro
 duct companies - May market products with questionable claims or potential
 ly harmful ingredients.\n> \n> It's worth noting that many of these indust

SUMMARY:We become inured to corruption
DESCRIPTION:I remember listening to the “The Rest is History” podcast a
 bout Reagan and his rôle in the Iran Contra scandal. The scandal was so c
 omplicated\, that although Reagan behaved much more corruptly than Nixon d
 id over Watergate\, he largely got away with it. Most normal people are no
 t obsessed with politics but can understand that paying people to break in
 to your political opponent’s campaign headquarters is definitely wrong. 
 When it comes to understanding the complicated web of transactions between
  Hezbollah\, Iran\, and an obscure guerilla group in Nicaragua\, they just
  tune out\, and watch the football instead. \n\nI am so old\, that I can r
 emember hearing about the Contras (and the Sandinistas\, who were their op
 ponents) on the news\, but I really didn’t understand how outrageous Rea
 gan’s behaviour had been.  I don't suppose I cared very much\, because i
 t didn't affect me\, and I wasn't interested in developing a framework for
  understanding how politics works. I still haven't developed the framework
 \, but at least now I'm working on it.

SUMMARY:What politicians learn from talking to people on the doorstep
DESCRIPTION:In a tiny way\, I have spent time knocking on doors and asking 
 people for their opinions about politics\, as a footsoldier in the never-e
 nding battle for votes. There is only one piece of information we want: wh
 ether or not you will vote for us.\n\nWe really don't give a damn about pe
 rsuading you about anything. We just want to avoid reminding you to vote i
 f you're likely to vote for the other lot. \n\nInterest in politics is a l
 uxury belief. People on the margins\, of managing\, or of being bothered a
 bout whether or not to vote\, don't give politics much thought. Supposedly
 \, they think about politics for four minutes a week. They really don't gi
 ve a stuff about anyone's policy on what to do with the Chagos Islands. Fr
 ankly\, it's hard to imagine foreign policy tipping the way any normal vot
 er decides to cast his vote.\n\nUnfortunately\, politicians take on board 
 what they hear on the doorstep. They take on board that policies really do
 n't matter. Image\, soundbites\, appearing on Strictly\, not letting a bil
 lionaire buy your glasses for you\, being a football supporter and going t
 o matches. These all matter much more. \n\nOne thing that really\, *really
 * doesn't matter\, for a backbench MP\, is diligiently reading all the bil
 ls forensically and holding the executive to account. That one thing that\
 , literally\, has a zero yield\, in terms of votes gained. Sigh.\n\n\n\n

SUMMARY:We are about to enter a recession -- possibly
DESCRIPTION:https://www.ft.com/content/c074dde0-7510-44c0-a178-8ca80254dfb1
 \n\nPeter Berezin has been pushing this thesis for a while. Of course\, ev
 entually he'll be right. Most professionals don't agree\, but there some m
 arkets seem to think the prediction is plausible:\n\n- US 10Y yields below
  4%\, even with inflation surely still hovering around that level\,\n- Chi
 na close to stall speed on an economy that's precariously positioned. Chin
 a is an aging society\, with most saving funnelled into the most unproduct
 ive asset of all: real estate\, especially residential RE (both at home an
 d abroad)\,\n- the Fed will probably drop rates by as much as 225bp over t
 he coming months. This will destabilize FX markets\, with the US sucking g
 rowth out of the rest of the world. \n- job data in the US is looking pret
 ty weak\, compared to the confident tone of a year ago.\n\nCommodity price
 s are very weak\, both energy and copper (and even uranium). These are set
  by companies with boots on the ground\, rather than armchair generals. Th
 e Fed has never successfully beaten inflation before without triggering a 
 recession. It'd be a miracle if it brought it off this time.

SUMMARY:Why people underestimate the importance of IQ
DESCRIPTION:I used to be a governor of a primary school. One of the endless
  series of fad directives that were being sent out at the time by the mini
 ster for education was the demand that primary schools teach some grammar.
 \nThis requirement was derided at the time by the educational establishmen
 t based on some cherry-picking of evidence (the minister wanted children t
 o correctly identify and use 'fronted adverbials'). \n\nAnyway\, a teacher
  at the school found the grammar difficult to understand\, and (presumably
 ) impossible to teach. The response of the head was to decide that what wa
 s needed was more professional training. Nobody dared suggest that\, just 
 maybe\, someone who struggles to understand the grammar of his mother tong
 ue is simply not clever enough to be a teacher.\n\nI think that part of th
 e problem of recognizing the limits to teaching is that our day-to-day con
 tact is mostly with people whose intelligence is not very different to our
 s. Fellows dining on high table in an Oxford college hall will differ wide
 ly in their knowledge and views on the world\, but won't vary hugely in ho
 w clever they are. Or\, at least\, most of them will not attribute diverge
 nce of views to divergence of intelligence.\n\nThis leads to the idea that
  it's possible to set up a place of learning\, and fix the lack of skills 
 that discourages industry setting up places of work in deprived areas. Nob
 ody argues that all the smart people got out of those areas years ago\, an
 d so it's too late for regeneration.\n\nAfter the poor reception to the id
 ea of teaching grammar\, the minister fought back by labelling the establi
 shment 'The Blob' and sticking out his tongue at it. OK\, the minister was
  Michael Gove. Oh\, and after praising his work\, Cameron replaced him by 
 someone who he knew would be more acceptable to the teachers: Nicky Morgan
 .\n

SUMMARY:The problem with public prosecution
DESCRIPTION:Public prosecution is a fairly recent thing.\nIn the past\, the
  courts were involved only if a private citizen (OK\, we're in the UK\, so
  'subject') took action.\nIt's easy to understand why having a public body
  bring a prosecution against someone for murder\, say\, but having this fu
 nction can form a slippery slope.\n\nSomething that shocked me a lot was t
 hat a relatively junior policeman of my acquaintance told me about a case 
 he wanted to pursue. It was a serious offence\, but collecting the evidenc
 e was going to take a lot of resources. His sergeant (well\, some sort of 
 superior officer) told him that they could not afford to investigate the c
 ase\, and that he should focus on ones which were easy to solve.\n\nI just
  got an email from Companies House saying that they were going to be 'more
  robust' in checking submissions. I can't help thinking that this will sim
 ply put an extra burden on small-scale companies like mine\, that always s
 trive to submit everything required\, and that the officers on the front l
 ike will quietly drop chasing companies that are evasive and reluctant to 
 supply information.\n\nI've spent a lot of time recently giving informatio
 n to banks\, to prove that I am not running a people-trafficking or drug-r
 unning operation. This seems to involve providing a lot of data about my m
 other's maiden name and recent transactions that I've made. \n\nI hear gen
 eral discussion about people taking a risk-based approach to these regulat
 ion enforcements\, but fire regulations in new houses seem to take the abs
 olute opposite approach. Even though my house has no naked flames\, and ha
 s perfectly new wiring\, still the fire protection systems are vastly more
  expensive and complex than the house I occupied as a kid\, which had open
  fires and someone who smoked in bed.\n\nDiscuss murder being a civil offe
 nce in Sharia law.

SUMMARY:Monopoly Round-Up: A Judge Can Break Up Google Right Now. Will He?
DESCRIPTION:View this post on the web at https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p
 /monopoly-round-up-a-judge-can-break\n\nThis week’s monopoly round-up ha
 s lots of news\, as usual\, including some victories for the Antitrust Div
 ision\, the government causing big health insurance stocks to tumble\, and
  a privacy bill deal in Congress.\nBut I want to start with a ray of hope 
 for those who want to break up big tech and are tired of waiting. A judge 
 in California finally has the power and mandate to take apart Google. Not 
 in five years. Not after a long trial. But right now. Will he? Guest-autho
 r and antitrust lawyer Lee Hepner has written an important piece on the su
 bject.\nLet’s dive in.  \nTo understand the biggest challenge to the pra
 ctice of antitrust\, it helps to start with a basic axiom of our legal sys
 tem\, which is the need for a speedy trial. You can go back to the Magna C
 arta and find indications of that principle\, or to Martin Luther King Jr.
 \, who wrote that “Justice too long delayed is justice denied.” In 197
 0\, Supreme Court Justice Warren Burger issued a warning to Congress and t
 he American Bar Association: "If people come to believe that inefficiency 
 and delay will drain even a just judgment of its value\,” he said [ http

 alculable damage to society.” \nOver the last ten years\, we’ve heard 
 increasing criticism of ‘Big Tech’ – the handful of trillion-dollar 
 giants that organize the information commons in our society – resulting 
 in the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission bringing sweeping a
 ntitrust lawsuits against Google [ https://substack.com/redirect/48eb06ed-

  ] the Biden suit against Apple and only 16% of respondents in opposition.
  It’s a tidal shift from just a decade ago\, when most people still saw 
 Big Tech as the crown jewels of American innovation. \nBut these hefty law
 suits are taking years to resolve\, with Google and Facebook suits filed i
 n 2020\, and not close to done four years later. And that\, as Justice War
 ren would have observed\, is a problem\, because it leaves a festering imp
 ression that there’s little anyone can do about market power. Every crus
 hed competitor\, every cheated customer\, they have to wait years for just
 ice. \nBut a private lawsuit against Google’s Play Store monopoly has re
 ceived much less attention even though it could bring relief much sooner. 
 In 2020\, Epic Games\, the studio behind the massively popular video game 
 Fortnite\, sued Google for illegally maintaining a monopoly over app store
  distribution on Android phones. Late last year\, in a jury trial\, Epic w
 on [ https://substack.com/redirect/d9fc3a52-8284-4670-b0b4-4e012459caa2?j=
 eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ]\, and next 
 week it will submit its request for remedies. And the judge in the case\, 
 James Donato of the Northern District Court of California\, is a confident
  lawyer willing to keep a brisk process moving. In fact\, he has publicly 
 encouraged antitrust plaintiffs to swing for the fences when requesting re
 lief.\nIn other words\, it’s a possibility\, perhaps even likely\, that 
 one of the biggest corporations in the world could be split apart over its
  monopolistic behavior. And it could happen this year.\nSo when’s the la
 st time a break-up happened? Most people would say AT&T in 1984\, when the
  phone giant was split apart in response to a government suit. It almost h
 appened in 1998\, when the government won a case against Microsoft. But th
 ose are government suits. What about a private lawsuit? Interestingly\, th
 e answer is actually… 2021\, when a private plaintiff\, exactly like Epi
 c Games\, won a case to break up [ https://substack.com/redirect/20ee4615-

 2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] a window and door making giant named Jeld-Wen. So there
 ’s very recent precedent.\nGoogle’s Epic Blunder\nWhy might a break-up
  make sense in this case? The answer to that question requires an understa
 nding of the facts and evidence in the case itself\, Google’s acquisitio
 n history\, and the purpose of remedies to unfetter markets from anticompe
 titive conduct and restore competition where it was constrained.\nIn Epic 
 v. Google\, Epic Games argued that Google is a monopolist of one of the ke
 y gateways on your phone\, which is the Google Play Store. With over 90% s
 hare of the markets for Android-based app distribution and in-app payment 
 systems\, Google controls how any other app developer – including Spotif
 y\, TikTok\, Amazon\, Facebook\, and beyond [ https://substack.com/redirec

 XVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] – reaches users on Android phones. (The ot
 her major phone system\, Apple’s iPhone\, is the subject of a different 
 antitrust suit also brought by Epic Games.)\nAt the core of Google’s Pla
 y Store monopoly is Android. Android is an operating system\, the brains o
 f the phone\, and Google acquired it back in 2005 so it could start cuttin
 g deals with mobile device makers. There are many producers of smartphones
 \, but virtually all of them (with the exception of Apple) now use Google
 ’s Android as their operating system.  Google doesn’t charge consumer
 s for Android directly\, but monetizes Android indirectly through its app 
 store and other highly profitable business lines that are bundled with And
 roid.\nOver the course of a 4-week trial nicknamed ‘Fortnite Court\,’

 1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] Epic sought to
  show how Google stops rivals from creating app stores that might compete 
 with the Google Play Store. Every antitrust trial is a morality play\, and
  in this story\, Google was easily cast as the villain\, with the judge sa
 nctioning [ https://substack.com/redirect/b2e3168d-5044-497f-8490-23c22f02
 b005?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] the 
 firm for destroying evidence relevant to the trial. And the proof Epic Gam
 es did present was overwhelming.\nEpic showed how Google forced agreements
  on smartphone manufacturers that required pre-installation and prominent 
 placement of the Play Store on hundreds of millions of devices. Smartphone
  manufacturers\, like Samsung and Motorola\, consented to this arrangement
  because Google gave them a lot of money through “revenue sharing agreem
 ents\,” paid for out of Google’s monopoly profits that smartphone manu
 facturers helped secure. These agreements created a closed platform ecosys
 tem\, or walled garden\, around Google’s business.\nGoogle didn’t just
  buy off smartphone manufacturers. When major developers like Activision\,
  Riot Games\, and Tencent became frustrated with Google’s 30% commission
  and threatened to develop their own distribution and payment systems\, Go
 ogle launched a “Play Risk Mitigation” strategy that included paying h
 undreds of millions [ https://substack.com/redirect/59c8d061-82a7-46e3-890

 H98 ] of dollars to prevent them from doing so. Google’s head of partner
 ships Don Harrison estimated [ https://substack.com/redirect/55eded17-d322

 lakvdPE7BH98 ] that there are now “billions of dollars flowing” betwee
 n Google and Activision-Blizzard (now a subsidiary of Microsoft) as part o
 f a deal to quash innovation by would-be rivals.\nAs a result\, Google now
  controls the only meaningful app store for Android phones and the primary
  gateway for how any other business reaches consumers. Its 30% commissions
  on all app sales and in-app payments is not a competitive price\, but a m
 onopoly price it extracts while preventing rival stores from undercutting 
 it. By comparison\, Epic’s Game Store proposed a commission of just 12%\
 , a far more attractive rate for developers that would likely have resulte
 d in lower prices for consumers\, too – if Epic could have gotten its fo
 ot in the door.\nThe financial incentive for Google to prevent companies l
 ike Epic\, Activision\, Spotify and Tencent from undercutting its monopoly
  profits is significant. In 2008\, Google said [ https://substack.com/redi
 rect/c92f470d-838e-4d03-a466-bb5442fab655?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fK
 DvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] that it had no intent to operate the Goog
 le Play Store as a profit center. By 2020\, the Google Play Store was\, on
  its own\, one of the most profitable business segments in the world\, wit
 h a 65 percent operating margin and $4.4 billion in half-year profit. \nA 
 jury found the evidence in Epic v. Google compelling\, deliberating for ju
 st under 4 hours before reaching a unanimous verdict that Google is an ill
 egal monopolist.\nBut the question at hand now is\, so what? And that’s 
 what makes this situation so interesting.\nA Verdict and $3 Can Buy You a 
 Cup of Coffee\nSo far\, what we know is that Google got dinged by a jury. 
 But absent a remedy that fully wrests control of the market from Google’
 s monopoly\, that verdict only exists on paper. Such a remedy can be broad
 -based\, anything from monetary damages to break-ups to creating internal 
 compliance departments to voiding unlawful contracts to banning senior exe
 cutives from the industry. \nEpic Games is\, conspicuously\, not asking fo
 r money\, but for the right to compete on a level playing field. Before Go
 ogle bought Android and converted it into a chokepoint in the value chain 
 between device manufacturers and consumers\, Android was an open-source op
 erating system. That’s what Epic has stated it is seeking to restore\, t
 he openness of the Android ecosystem for the benefit of all developers and
  consumers.\nForcing Google to spinoff Android may be the cleanest way to 
 achieve this goal and blow open a lane for new competition and innovation 
 to occur. Developers other than Google could seek arrangements with Androi
 d that simultaneously increase the quality and diversity of apps\, lower c
 osts for developers and consumers\, and encourage smartphone innovation. A
 t the dawn of artificial intelligence\, a structural separation of Android
  would also loosen Google’s grip on innovation at the relative infancy o
 f that technology.\nThough a breakup of Google might sound radical\, it’

 -fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] led to an explosion of competition and
  innovation among telephone device manufacturers and long-distance telecom
 munications providers – and lower prices for consumers. A similar positi
 ve outcome would flow from a structural separation of Google and Android\,
  which would blow open the smartphone field for innovation among developer
 s and device manufacturers currently under Google’s thumb.\nBreakups are
  particularly effective where\, as with Google and Android\, the implicate
 d business segments have natural fault lines [ https://substack.com/redire

 ten the case with monopolies that were the result of mergers – again\, l
 ike the merger of Google and Android –  which combine inherently distin
 ct business segments\, and which remain visibly distinct. (Jeld-Wen was an
  unwinding of a merger.)\nBy comparison\, the costs associated with ineffe
 ctive behavioral remedies [ https://substack.com/redirect/1cb30f2a-19c5-41

 vdPE7BH98 ] are significant\, such as monitoring for compliance\, addressi
 ng evasion\, chilled innovation by the constrained actor\, and the costs o
 f hampering a company’s ability to adapt to market conditions. More fund
 amentally\, an ineffective remedy is justice delayed\, which as Justice Wa
 rren said so many years ago\, is corrosive to society. Both FTC Chair Lina
  Khan and DOJ Antitrust Chief Jonathan Kanter have made clear their aversi
 on to behavioral remedies [ https://substack.com/redirect/d8fb93b0-0f74-4b

 vdPE7BH98 ] and an intent to “pursue structural remedies in our conduct 
 cases whenever possible.”\nIt’s pretty obvious big tech firms see laws
  as suggestions. In recent months\, Apple has drawn criticism for its “m
 alicious non-compliance [ https://substack.com/redirect/040cedd7-42f3-4e1f

 ’s separate app store case against Apple. In the latter case\, Apple was
  ordered to allow developers to use third-party payment systems\, but is u
 ndercutting would-be competition by taking a 27% commission for facilitati
 ng those transactions. Google too is under investigation in Europe for sim
 ilar behavior [ https://substack.com/redirect/44da0d38-9407-46b8-a83d-4ed4
 944b9962?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuAta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] 
 in refusing to comply with the law. As long as Google retains control over
  the Android operating system\, it would do the same.\nThe Courage to Prov
 ide Effective Relief\nSo how is Judge Donato thinking about the problem? A
 t a recent status conference in Epic v. Google\, he made clear his aversio
 n to behavioral remedies that would require ongoing court supervision or o
 therwise result in awkward micromanagement of Google: “I’m not going t
 o say ‘you can have four click screens\, not eight.” He added\, “I h
 ave great doubts I’m in any position to set a fee that developers might 
 pay.” Moreover\, he is curious about the behavior of other dominant tech
  firms in response to remedies that seem to have failed. (“What did Appl
 e just do?” he asked\, about malicious non-compliance over the judicial 
 order in Epic’s other antitrust case.)\nEpic has a clear opportunity to 
 request structural remedies and Judge Donato has broad latitude to grant t
 hem. If Epic doesn’t call for Google to spin off Android\, it may still 
 call for other forms of structural relief\, like compulsory licensing of c
 ore tech infrastructure\, that could go a long way to restoring competitio
 n to broader markets. We’ll know Epic’s request soon enough\, Google w
 ill file its own more limited proposal\, and dueling economic experts will
  jump in another of Judge Donato’s “hot tubs” [ https://substack.com
 /redirect/9b49695e-6484-49a7-836a-7c2b4f7efe59?j=eyJ1Ijoibm1idCJ9.oKN8sNuA
 ta-fKDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ] at the end of May. Shortly thereafte
 r\, Judge Donato will decide how and whether Google’s vice grip over the
  Android ecosystem should be meaningfully weakened.\nWhy is all of this im
 portant? Innovation\, whether on smartphones or tablets or augmented reali
 ty headsets\, works best when wrested from the control of monopolists whos
 e overriding motivation is the preservation of their monopoly. We all bene
 fit when companies are forced to differentiate themselves by offering new 
 and better products\, or\, at the very least\, the same old things at lowe
 r prices. \nFor its part\, Epic has a powerful verdict in hand. For it to 
 be more than pyrrhic\, remedies must now accomplish several goals: they mu
 st unfetter the market from monopoly power\, they must deprive the monopol
 ist of the spoils of its illegal conduct\, and they must provide certainty
  that the monopoly will not re-emerge.\nPerhaps more importantly\, Judge D
 onato has the ability to help Americans understand that the rule of law ac
 tually means something\, and that when a jury says that a giant firm has b
 roken the law\, the wrongdoing will be remedied. Given that mandate\, the 
 biggest impediment to an effective remedy is lacking the temerity to impos
 e one that may actually work.\nAnd now for the monopoly related news of th
 e week...\n\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6L

 mentalism of the 1990s. I watched “Captain Planet.” I celebrated Earth
  Day at school. I still\, out of habits formed then\, cut up plastic soda 
 rings to avoid harming marine life. Then I recycle the plastic. Or at leas
 t recycling is what I’d like to think I’m doing\, even though I know t
 he reality <https://link.propublica.net/click/35797899.141619/aHR0cHM6Ly9n

 ublished an investigation that reveals how fossil fuel and chemical compan
 ies that rely on plastic production — some of the same companies that pr
 omoted the recycling campaigns I remember from the 1990s — are touting a
 nother method of plastic recycling <https://link.propublica.org/click/3579

 1b104271Feac6f5ea>. This type of “chemical” recycling\, they allege\, 
 is supposed to be much better than old-school “mechanical” recycling\,
  which yields plastic that’s degraded or contaminated. This method promi
 ses hard-to-recycle plastics like candy wrappers and grocery bags will not
  only finally be recyclable but could be recycled again and again\, perhap
 s infinitely.\n\nThe “advanced” recycling method is a chemical process
  called pyrolysis. “Pyro” means fire and “lysis” means separation\
 , Lisa explained. The process uses heat to break plastic all the way down 
 to its molecular building blocks.\n\nOne of the companies that promotes it
 s own method of pyrolysis\, aptly branded as the “Exxtend” process\, i
 s ExxonMobil. In late August of last year\, Lisa found\, ExxonMobil joined
  two other companies in announcing to the world <https://link.propublica.n

 eb847611b104271Cdd7b35ba> that its use of pyrolysis had yielded a fruit cu
 p.\n\n(Source: Printpack press release)\n\nLisa\, who has covered environm
 ental issues for years\, became obsessed with these fruit cups that seemed
  to prove it was possible to make endlessly recyclable products. But as in
 vestigative reporters\, it’s our job to be skeptical. And so began Lisa
 ’s journey to get to the bottom of how\, exactly\, plastic-dependent ind
 ustries are using pyrolysis and whether it’s as effective as they say it
  is.\n\nShe ran into a wall almost immediately.\n\nNobody at any of the th
 ree companies behind the fruit cup answered detailed questions about the c
 up’s availability or how it was made. Lisa tried — fruitlessly — to 
 locate the cups in a store or find some other way to buy them. But she ran
  into dead ends there\, too.\n\n“For months\,” she wrote\, “I tracke
 d press releases\, interviewed experts\, tried to buy plastic made via pyr
 olysis and learned more than I ever wanted to know about the science of re
 cycled molecules.”\n\nThe result of her pursuit is this week’s story <

 ljbGluZy1weXJvbHlzaXM/65538bd98eb847611b104271Geac6f5ea>\, which I highly 
 recommend you read. It’s a real trip\, and full of useful\, detailed bre
 akdowns of each of her findings\, which include the following:\n\n* Most o
 f the old plastic that goes into pyrolysis doesn’t actually become new p
 lastic.\n\n* The plastic that comes out of pyrolysis contains very little 
 recycled material.\n\n* The industry uses mathematical acrobatics to make 
 pyrolysis look like a success.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nAt the v
 ery least\, you should be skeptical when you’re deciphering the plastic-
 industry lingo on recyclable packaging. For example\, if you scroll back u
 p to that press-release image of the plastic cups\, you’ll see in the to
 p right corner a circular label that says “ISCC.” The text of the pres
 s release says the fruit cup product has “30% ISCC PLUS certified-circul
 ar content.” Naturally\, you might think this means that the fruit cup i
 s made of 30% recycled plastic.\n\nThat’s not the case.\n\nLisa worked w
 ith graphics editor Lucas Waldron to create charts that help show how rule
 s created by industry-affiliated groups like the International Sustainabil
 ity and Carbon Certification allow companies to shuffle numbers related to
  the “recycled-ness” of various products so they end up with potential
 ly misleading packaging information. The plastics industry and green marke
 ters call this calculation “mass balance\,” and they argue that it is 
 crucial to the future of advanced recycling. ISCC didn’t respond to Lisa
 ’s requests for comment. Though ExxonMobil didn’t respond to her quest
 ions about the fruit cup\, the company has defended the use of mass balanc
 e <https://link.propublica.net/click/35797899.141619/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZG9jd

 2425>\, saying\, “The science of advanced recycling simply does not supp
 ort any other approach because the ability to track individual molecules d
 oes not readily exist.”\n\nIn the end\, Lisa never got her hands on that
  elusive fruit cup. But that doesn’t mean she didn’t get the answers s
 he was looking for.\n\n“I ran down half a dozen claims about products th
 at came out of pyrolysis\; each either existed in limited quantities or ha
 d its recycled-ness obscured with mass balance caveats\,” she wrote.\n\n
 The story provided me with answers\, too\, to questions I didn’t even kn
 ow I had. But I’m still at a loss as to what to do with the plastic ring
 s that hold six-packs together\, so I asked Lisa. She told me\, “The sad
  reality is that every question about\, ‘Is this specific thing actually
  recycled?’ would be its own investigation — and the answer would be d
 ifferent depending on your local municipality.”\n\nFor now\, I’ll keep
  cutting the rings out of habit. And even though I’m not sure what will 
 happen to the pieces\, I know that “pyrolysis” will almost certainly h
 ave nothing to do with it.\n\n<https://link.propublica.org/click/35797899.

SUMMARY:Never meet your heroes
DESCRIPTION:When we grow up\, with find people we idolize. As we get older\
 , we learn that even the most saintly and talented individuals usually hav
 e feet of clay. In fact\, the more charismatic a leader is\, the more like
 ly he is to be a failure as a human being. \n\nI assume this is because\, 
 as humans\, we only have so much capacity for thought\, doing good\, carin
 g for people. Those who care about the greater good\, usually miss the suf
 fering of those around them.\n\nExamples:\n\nBiden ('Wall St. Always Wins'
 )\,\nNixon (?)\,\n... ask chatgpt for more.\n

SUMMARY:Economic rents and excess profits
DESCRIPTION:Economic rents arise from barriers to entry\, a supply constrai
 nt. This can arise from natural shortages of supply: think de Beers and di
 amonds\, or land for agriculture. \n\nBut aren't all returns the result of
  some sort of supply constraint? Isn't an interest rate a reflection of th
 e shortage of supply of capital\, because people need to consume what they
  produce?\n\nWhat about salaries and wages? Are high salaries for investme
 nt bankers a result on a genuine excess economic  production created by th
 is sector\, or are they a reflection of the very tight supply of bankers w
 ho are trusted to do large corporate deals?\n\nCan we even distinguish bet
 ween these returns? Are not all profits the result of a distribution of ec
 onomic rents to the various factors of production?

SUMMARY:A new way of thinking about inflation
DESCRIPTION:Real interest rates are pinned to the marginal utility of capit
 al. If deferred consumption can't be turned into a real retun\, then the r
 eal interest rate will go down. As more capital is created\, the marginal 
 return on capital will decrease\, real rates will go down.\n\nNominal rate
 s are\, largely\, controlled by central banks. The BoJ can keep nominal ra
 tes at zero indefinitely\, and can do a pretty good job of yield curve con
 trol. But there has to be a means of reconciling the nominal and real inte
 rest rates\, and this is the inflation rate. So this is\, in one sense\, a
  monetary phenomenon.\n\nTie this into exchange rates. Reconcile this with
  the idea that long-term rates link into the growth potential of the econo
 my.

SUMMARY:Hedonic Treadmill
DESCRIPTION:<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill>\n\nThe idea t
 hat whatever you consume\, however rich you are\, you always end up at the
  same level of utility. It seems completely opposed to the convex utility 
 function stuff that underpins economics. No matter how much good stuff you
  get\, you want more\, so you end up like Jamie Dimon.\n\nMany successful 
 individuals grapple with unhappiness despite their achievements\, and seve
 ral factors contribute to this paradox.\n\n## **Reasons for Unhappiness Am
 ong Successful People**\n\n1. **Social Comparisons**: High achievers often
  use social comparisons to measure their success\, leading to feelings of 
 inadequacy. This tendency can create a cycle of envy and dissatisfaction\,
  as they constantly compare themselves to others who seem more successful[
 1][2].\n\n2. **Pressure and Expectations**: Successful individuals frequen
 tly face immense pressure to maintain their status or achieve even greater
  heights. This relentless pursuit can lead to stress and burnout\, oversha
 dowing moments of joy and fulfillment[2][3].\n\n3. **Isolation**: Extreme 
 success can result in feelings of loneliness. The lifestyle that comes wit
 h high achievement often disconnects individuals from simpler\, more relat
 able experiences\, making it harder for them to connect with others on a p
 ersonal level[2][4].\n\n4. **The Hedonic Treadmill**: Many successful peop
 le experience the "hedonic treadmill\," where initial boosts in happiness 
 from accomplishments quickly fade. They find themselves needing ever-great
 er achievements or material possessions to feel satisfied\, which can lead
  to chronic dissatisfaction[1][3].\n\n5. **Guilt and Shame**: Some success
 ful individuals feel guilty about their unhappiness\, believing they shoul
 d be content given their wealth and accomplishments. This guilt can exacer
 bate feelings of inadequacy and despair[3][6].\n\n6. **Lack of Mastery**: 
 A focus on external markers of success (like income or status) rather than
  personal mastery can lead to unhappiness. When individuals fail to engage
  in activities that they genuinely enjoy or excel at\, they miss out on th
 e intrinsic rewards that contribute to well-being[1][4].\n\n7. **Materiali
 sm**: The pursuit of material goods often leads to temporary satisfaction 
 rather than lasting happiness. Once the novelty wears off\, individuals ma
 y find themselves yearning for more\, creating a cycle of unfulfilled desi
 res[3][6].\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWhile success is often equated with hap
 piness\, the reality is more complex. Many successful people experience un
 happiness due to social pressures\, isolation\, and a focus on external va
 lidation rather than personal fulfillment. Understanding these dynamics ca
 n help shift perspectives towards what truly contributes to long-term happ
 iness—engaging in meaningful activities and fostering genuine connection
 s with others.\n\nCitations:\n[1] https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/why

SUMMARY:Buying Back the Farm
DESCRIPTION:View this post on the web at https://www.yesigiveafig.com/p/buy
 ing-back-the-farm\n\nSummary:\nCommon financial theories about corporate s
 hare buybacks and their impact on market dynamics are flawed on both sides
 . The Modigliani Miller dividend irrelevance theorem is irrelevant in prac
 tice and do not account for the realities of market operation.\nThe nature
  of the shareholder base and the company's dividend policy significantly a
 ffect the market impact of buybacks\, and inelastic markets are key to sha
 ping stock prices and market movements. Dividends and buybacks are not equ
 ivalent in their effect on markets\, challenging prevailing financial theo
 ries and practices.\nInstitutional Subscribers: Last week’s recording wa
 s corrupted\, and I apologize. If there is interest\, I’m happy to host 
 a second call on Friday\, April 19th. Please reach out directly and let me
  know. \nDue to Delay\, No Top Comment\nI had hoped this was going to be o
 ne of my shorter notes as I’m typing from an armchair in Annapolis\, MD\
 , during a short visit rather than sitting at any of my dozen temporary de
 sks over the past year. The next few weeks are chaotic\, to say the least\
 , with trips to Annapolis\, Miami\, San Francisco\, Raleigh-Durham\, Charl
 eston (SC)\, Greenville (SC)\, Savannah (GA)\, New York\, and Connecticut.
  With wife and dogs for much of the travel. Wish me luck.\nThe Main Event\
 nWhile I had planned on writing on gold (and have the post 90% done)\, thi
 s past week I had one of my favorite “passive” discussions with Ben Fe
 lix and Cameron Passmore of PWL Capital up in Canada and this has pushed m
 e in a different direction. While I have no meaningful knowledge of their 
 firm\, I will frame Ben\, the Head of Research at PWL\, as the “anti-Bat
 nick” despite their passing similitude and shared defense of passive inv
 esting. When I was first directed to Ben’s work\, I wrote a slightly les
 s mean version of the now archived “Cleanup on Aisle Four” (rewritten 
 as “Be Better [ https://substack.com/redirect/c5ee35cf-12cb-401f-b848-ff

 KDvVXVf40Ijrk4j2KaDlakvdPE7BH98 ]. I’m really looking forward to the rea
 ction because BEN DID THE WORK. And guess what\, he now understands. In a 
 fatherly/professorial way\, I’m extremely proud of him. Unfortunately\, 
 he also recognizes\, as I continually emphasize\, that there’s really no
 thing an individual investor (or wealth management firm) can do. Passive i
 nvesting IS breaking markets\, and the results will prove catastrophic. Bu
 t until then\, it’s almost mathematically guaranteed to outperform activ
 e management. Exactly WHEN and exactly WHAT is the catalyst that pricks th
 e bubble is unknowable\, but it IS coming. We discuss some of the reasons 
 during the podcast\, but the simplest answer is that withdrawals are a fun
 ction of asset levels while contributions are a function of incomes. Event
 ually\, the withdrawals will swamp the contributions\, and the system will
  start to fall. Unfortunately\, with asset levels now higher relative to i
 ncomes than ever in history\, we know we’re closer to the end than the b
 eginning of this story. I wish we weren’t\, but we are.\nWhile I don’t
  think there is anything individuals can do\, other than raise awareness a
 nd understanding\, I do share my recommendations. If you happen to make it
  through any of my in-person presentations\, you’ll find this slide:\nNo
 te the highlighted policy recommendation #5. One of the reasons the curren
 t environment has persisted is the growing role of corporate share buyback
 s in providing both competition and support for traded shares. Anyone wort
 h their salt in the finance industry has at least a rudimentary familiarit
 y with the Modigliani Miller dividend irrelevance theorem and the implicat
 ions for stock buybacks:\n Now regular readers of my work will immediately
  gravitate to the warning flags — “perfect capital market” and Effic
 ient Market Hypothesis. For those who might not know the definition of a 
 “perfect” capital market:\nWell\, that sounds a lot like the markets I
  know and love. No entry barriers\, no transaction costs\, no tax differen
 tials\, equal access to borrowing and lending opportunities… and firm va
 lue absolutely equal to the PV of cash flows….  Excuse me for a moment
