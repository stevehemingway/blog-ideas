Summary: Cladding issue
Description: Email candidates with "Can't sell my flat, cladding problem".

Get answers: "We are committed to leasehold reform. We are sorry that you are having problems. Vote for us."

It's fairly clear that nobody has read the actual email, but someone (or an AI) has picked up the word 'leasehold' and a standard answer has been generated in the hope that a bland "We share your pain and we promise to make it go away" answer will secure this person's vote.
