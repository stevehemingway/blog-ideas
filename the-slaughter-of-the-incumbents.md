# The slaughter of the incumbents

In 2024, numerous incumbent governments around the world were voted out of office, reflecting a global trend of anti-incumbency. The countries where this occurred include:

* United States: Donald Trump defeated incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris19.
* United Kingdom: The Labour Party won 411 seats, ending 14 years of Conservative rule6.
* France: President Macron's party lost its majority, leading to a fragile government5.
* South Korea: The liberal opposition coalition defeated the ruling conservative Power Party in parliamentary elections5.
* India: Prime Minister Modi's BJP lost its parliamentary majority but maintained power through alliances5.
* Japan: The Liberal Democratic Party suffered significant losses, curtailing its dominance5.
* Botswana: Voters ousted a party that had been in power for 58 years since independence5.
* Senegal: Bassirou Diomaye Faye became the first opposition candidate to win a presidential election in the first round since independence4.
* Sri Lanka: Voters delivered a landslide win to the opposition4.
* South Africa: The African National Congress lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since 19942.

Additionally, incumbent parties lost significant ground or faced setbacks in several European countries, including Belgium, Austria, Croatia, Bulgaria, Czechia, Slovakia, and Lithuania2.
It's worth noting that this trend was observed across various political spectrums and regions, with over 80% of democracies that held elections in 2024 seeing the incumbent party lose seats or vote share4.
