@# Helping kids with dyslexia read

Have an editor syntax colour natural language text.

Real-time correction of punctuation and grammar errors.

Possibility of text to speech, both as text is being written and read.

Dyslexia is complicated. Sometimes it interferes with just writing, sometimes reading and writing. Speech is a hard-wired skill that has evolved in humans over many millions of years. Interpreting and creating a written representation is a new invention, for which we do not have any hard-wired processing. 

The rise of AI in 'understanding' written language is astonishing. Maybe the insights into how neural networks behave in silicon can help us gain a greater understanding of how they work in our ancient, biological, brains.
