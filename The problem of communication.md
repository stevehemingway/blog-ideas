# The problem of communication

Man, the species, is a communicator. All organisms communicate, to an extent; bacteria have their ways. 
Birds screech and caw, lions roar. But humans are the world champions. 
Even the most inarticulate human can communicate much, much more than a chimp.

AI has solved the language problem. Chomsky said that all languages use a common deep grammar. 
Large language models show that every word, with every meaning, in every language, can be mapped onto a point in an insanely large-dimensional space.

We are great at speaking, but also great at misunderstanding. We all load every word, phrase, inflection with a unique significance. 
High-bandwidth communication between humans, via written or spoken language, is trickier than you think. 
Because we all *think* we understand what is being said, because we cannot compare it to *exactly* what the speaker had in mind.

That's why a lot of middle-managers exist. In IT, you can't let the geeky coder talk to the head of sales. 
They speak the same language, English, but they don't speak the same dialect. They don't have a common understanding. 
The traditional layers of communication, between user and coder, were there for a reason. 
Maybe they blocked any kind of iteration of design (the 'waterfall model'), maybe they degraded the signal, so that the receiver heard the requirements like we hear music through an AM radio (remember them!). But it got through.

Light struggles to get across media with different refractive indices. Power transmission fails when it goes through parts of a circuit where there is an impedence mismatch. You need to match source and sink, or you lose stuff. The best political communicators are those who don't think too deeply. Ronald Reagan was never going to win a Nobel Prize in economics, but he explained stuff in a way that voters understood, even if it was a partial picture. The same went for Margaret Thatcher, with her shopping bag analogies.

As we have less and less shared experience, from schools to TV programmes, these barriers get larger. Whatever the intrinsic merits of Old Etonians, stuffing your cabinet full of them more or less guarantees they can correctly your vision, even if they do not share it. Even a brilliant product of a bog-standard comprehensive would struggle to work with Dave.
I am not surprised that nobody defends the shrinking pool of candidates for high office, but it makes sense, even if it's repugnant.
There is an economic cost to making everyone equal in power and income. But there is a great social gain, as a society with members who can understand each other is a more contented one.

It's difficult to communicate without an impedence match.

It's difficult to communicate when there is a disparity of income.

There is a difficulty of communication when there is a disparity of power.
