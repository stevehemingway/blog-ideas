@# Get rid of FoI

Make everything that is not secret is dumped into publically-accessible. Ideally, it should be indexed, but Google will index it for free.

This reverse the normal burden of proof. Civil servants will have to justify not routinely publishing documents, rather than having to decide on a case-by-case basis what they're willing to share.
