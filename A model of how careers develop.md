# A model of how careers develop

Your value as an older worker is tied to your "social capital". This goes up a lot more for salesmen than for programmers. Working long hours and having mental agility is all very well, but this atrophies with age. 

Programmers almost never end up as CEOs. This is about the best explanation I've seen so far. Also, getting a computer to do stuff is about as bad a preparation for getting a human to do stuff as it is possible to imagine.

The accumulation of **social capital**—the networks, relationships, and social resources that individuals can draw upon—plays a significant role in explaining the wide variability of income levels within elite institutions like investment banks. Here's how social capital influences income disparities in such settings:

---

### 1. **Access to Opportunities**
   - **Networks and Referrals**: In elite institutions, many high-paying roles are filled through referrals and personal connections rather than open applications. Individuals with strong social capital (e.g., alumni networks, family connections, or ties to influential figures) are more likely to gain access to lucrative positions or clients.
   - **Deal Flow**: In investment banking, securing high-value deals often depends on relationships with corporate executives, government officials, or wealthy individuals. Those with extensive social networks can leverage these connections to bring in business, directly impacting their income through bonuses and commissions.

---

### 2. **Reputation and Trust**
   - **Reputation as Social Capital**: In elite institutions, reputation is a form of social capital. Individuals who are well-regarded within their networks are more likely to be trusted with high-stakes projects or leadership roles, which often come with higher compensation.
   - **Client Relationships**: Investment bankers with strong social capital can build long-term relationships with clients, leading to repeat business and higher earnings. Trust and familiarity are critical in securing and maintaining these relationships.

### 3. **Mentorship and Sponsorship**
   - **Mentorship**: Individuals with access to influential mentors—often a result of social capital—receive guidance, career advice, and introductions to key players in the industry. This can accelerate career progression and income growth.
   - **Sponsorship**: Senior professionals with social capital may act as sponsors, advocating for their protégés during promotions or bonus discussions. This can lead to significant income disparities between those with and without such support.

---

### 4. **Cultural and Social Fit**
   - **Elite Cultural Capital**: Investment banks often value cultural capital—shared norms, behaviors, and tastes associated with elite groups. Individuals who align with these cultural expectations (e.g., attending prestigious schools, participating in exclusive clubs) are more likely to be seen as "fitting in" and may advance more quickly, leading to higher income.
   - **Social Exclusion**: Those without the "right" social or cultural capital may face barriers to advancement, even if they are highly skilled, contributing to income variability.

---

### 5. **Geographic and Institutional Networks**
   - **Geographic Concentration**: Elite institutions are often concentrated in financial hubs like New York, London, or Hong Kong. Individuals with social capital in these regions (e.g., through family, education, or prior work experience) have an advantage in accessing high-paying roles.
   - **Institutional Ties**: Graduates of top-tier universities or former employees of prestigious firms often have built-in networks that provide access to elite institutions, creating a pipeline that reinforces income disparities.

---

### 6. **Performance Metrics and Social Capital**
   - **Subjective Evaluations**: While performance metrics are important, subjective evaluations by senior leaders often play a role in determining bonuses and promotions. Social capital can influence these evaluations, as individuals with stronger relationships may be perceived more favorably.
   - **Team Dynamics**: In investment banking, success often depends on collaboration. Those with strong social capital can assemble high-performing teams or secure support from colleagues, enhancing their performance and income potential.

---

### 7. **Cumulative Advantage (Matthew Effect)**
   - **Feedback Loop**: Social capital creates a feedback loop where initial advantages (e.g., attending a prestigious school) lead to more opportunities, which in turn generate even greater social capital. This "Matthew Effect" (the rich get richer) exacerbates income variability over time.
   - **Compounding Benefits**: Over a career, the compounding benefits of social capital—such as access to better deals, clients, and promotions—can lead to significant income disparities between individuals with similar skills but different levels of social capital.

### Conclusion
In elite institutions like investment banks, social capital acts as a critical determinant of income variability. It shapes access to opportunities, reputation, mentorship, cultural fit, and performance evaluations, creating a system where those with strong social networks and connections often earn significantly more than their peers. This dynamic reinforces existing inequalities and highlights the importance of social capital in high-stakes, competitive environments.
