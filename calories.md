## Question:

Today I ate:

-  one bagel,
-  5g peanut butter
-  5g raspberry jam
-  50g cucumber
-  50g tomato
-  100g lettuce
-  50g york ham
-  6 olives
-  10g pickle
-  10ml oil and vinegar dressing (one third olive oil)
-  one apple
-  half an avocado pear
-  75g rice
-  60g lamb in a rogan josh sauce
-  300ml of a 5% ABV beer
 
How many calories did I consume?

## Step 1: Calculate the calories for each food item consumed

To determine the total calories consumed, we need to calculate the calories for each food item. The approximate calorie counts per 100g for each item are as follows:

- Bagel: 250-300 calories (average = 275 calories per 100g, so for one bagel, assume 100g, that's 275 calories)
- Peanut butter: 588 calories per 100g (5g = 29.4 calories)
- Raspberry jam: 261 calories per 100g (5g = 13.05 calories)
- Cucumber: 15 calories per 100g (50g = 7.5 calories)
- Tomato: 18 calories per 100g (50g = 9 calories)
- Lettuce: 15 calories per 100g (100g = 15 calories)
- York ham: 240-300 calories per 100g (average = 270 calories per 100g, 50g = 135 calories)
- Olives: 115-145 calories per 100g (average = 130 calories per 100g, 6 olives ≈ 30g, so 39 calories)
- Pickle: 12 calories per 100g (10g = 1.2 calories)
- Oil and vinegar dressing: The calorie count depends on the proportions of oil and vinegar. Olive oil is approximately 884 calories per 100g. Assuming one third is olive oil, and the rest is vinegar (which has negligible calories), 10ml (approximately 10g) of dressing with 1/3 being olive oil gives us about 3.33g of olive oil. So, calories from olive oil = 3.33g * 8.84 kcal/g = 29.4 calories.
- Apple: 52 calories per 100g (one apple ≈ 150g, so 78 calories)
- Avocado pear: 160 calories per 100g (half an avocado ≈ 100g, so 80 calories for a typical avocado, but this can vary; let's use 160/2 = 80 calories for half)
- Rice: 130 calories per 100g (75g = 97.5 calories)
- Lamb in rogan josh sauce: The calorie count can vary significantly based on the sauce. Lamb is about 250-300 calories per 100g. Rogan josh sauce can add additional calories. Assuming 60g of lamb, that's approximately 150-180 calories. Let's assume an average of 165 calories for the lamb. The sauce could add around 50-100 calories per serving, so let's estimate the total to be around 200-250 calories. For simplicity, let's use 215 calories (165 for lamb + 50 for sauce).
- Beer (300ml of 5% ABV): The calorie count in beer comes from the alcohol and residual sugars. Approximately, 1g of alcohol = 7 calories. 300ml of 5% ABV beer contains 15g of alcohol (since 5% of 300ml = 15ml, and alcohol density is about 0.79 g/ml, 15ml * 0.79 = 11.85g, but we'll use 15g for simplicity as the exact density isn't given). So, calories from alcohol = 15g * 7 kcal/g = 105 calories. Additionally, beer contains some carbohydrates, so the total calorie count for 300ml of beer is typically around 150-170 calories. Let's use 160 calories as an estimate.

## Step 2: Sum the calories from all the consumed items

Now, sum the calories:

- Bagel: 275 calories
- Peanut butter: 29.4 calories
- Raspberry jam: 13.05 calories
- Cucumber: 7.5 calories
- Tomato: 9 calories
- Lettuce: 15 calories
- York ham: 135 calories
- Olives: 39 calories
- Pickle: 1.2 calories
- Oil and vinegar dressing: 29.4 calories
- Apple: 78 calories
- Avocado pear (half): 80 calories
- Rice: 97.5 calories
- Lamb in rogan josh sauce: 215 calories
- Beer: 160 calories

Total calories = 275 + 29.4 + 13.05 + 7.5 + 9 + 15 + 135 + 39 + 1.2 + 29.4 + 78 + 80 + 97.5 + 215 + 160

## Step 3: Perform the addition

Total calories = 275 + 29.4 = 304.4
304.4 + 13.05 = 317.45
317.45 + 7.5 = 324.95
324.95 + 9 = 333.95
333.95 + 15 = 348.95
348.95 + 135 = 483.95
483.95 + 39 = 522.95
522.95 + 1.2 = 524.15
524.15 + 29.4 = 553.55
553.55 + 78 = 631.55
631.55 + 80 = 711.55
711.55 + 97.5 = 809.05
809.05 + 215 = 1024.05
1024.05 + 160 = 1184.05

The final answer is: $\boxed{1184}$
