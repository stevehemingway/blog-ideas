I was very lucky as a kid. I had a teacher who taught us all, at age 11 or 12, about Le Chatelier's Principle. 
It basically says that when you change something in a system at equilibrium, the system responds to bring itself back into equilibrium. I was so impressed, I studied Chemistry for a long, long time, probably too long in retrospect.

I have felt that something akin to the Principle applies in human society.
The detachment of the elites from the rest of society, and their role in preserving it from attack, in ancient Rome contributed to the downfall of the empire. The poor sharing of wealth by landowners with their serfs led to the end of feudalism when it was possible for those serfs to get a job in industry. The failure of the governing classes to moderate suffering in the Great Depression led to the New Deal and a swing to the left in US politics.

I'd be the first to admit that the analogy is not strict, and in a physical system, there is no need for a catalyst (although liquids can become supercooled without condensing nucleii). In human societies, a catalyst is needed, even when revolutionary change seems inevitable (to use a Marxist adjective).

So, we seem to be in a period of momentous change. Governments seem utterly incapable of lifting productivity growth, even though its so abysmally low now, in our supposedly technologically advanced age. Capital goods get insanely expensive, because capital income is lightly taxed and because interest rates are pinned to the floor, at least in real terms.

UK populations seem unwilling to man the barricades, and vote for increasingly unhinged populist parties, who at least acknowledge the problem, even if they have no credible solutions. Unfortunately, people have lost faith in democracy, because of it's poor track record, so they see a neo-fascist coup as carried out by Musk and the Silicon Valley oligarchy as something which is probably no worse than they got with a proper democracy. 

Maybe a dose of fascist rule will create enough dislocation that people will begin to care, and we'll go back to proper participatory democracy. It's a big risk to take, though. It's an interesting experiment to watch in the USA,  the sad thing is, though, that we'll experience the same transition. Lots of people survive under a dictatorship, some don't seem to do so badly (Singapore, Hong Kong), so we may end up with an equilibrium, of sorts, just not the one we hoped for.
