Spain has a lot of generation via renewables, and yet has much, much cheaper electricity than the UK. (https://www.omie.es/en/market-results/daily/daily-market/day-ahead-price). My guess is that (i) solar panels just don't work that well in a cloudy, northern country and (ii) wind turbines are an expensive way of generating power, even in a windy country like ours.

To put this into perspective, let's look at some global data. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2022, global fossil fuel consumption has continued to rise over the last thirty years. In 1990, global fossil fuel consumption was approximately 6,373 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). By 2021, this had risen to 11,048 Mtoe, representing a 73% increase.

We've spent a lot of money subsidising renewables, even though our contribution to total CO2 output is very modest. The UK's CO2 emissions from energy combustion were 0.9% of the global total in 2021. Presumably, the motivation behind this was to set an example to the rest of the world. However, the brutal truth is that they are ignoring us. Global fuel consumption now is two and a half times what it was in 1970, and has barely changed since 2010, in spite of countries like ours retiring all our coal plants, because India and China open new ones quicker than the rest of the world close ours.

Let's examine the average electricity costs in countries with a high proportion of renewables in their energy mix, such as Denmark, Germany, and Spain, compared to those with lower renewable penetration, like the USA, India, Chile, and Vietnam.

* Denmark: 30-40 € cents/kWh (residential), with renewables accounting for around 50% of electricity generation (source: Eurostat)
* Germany: 35-45 € cents/kWh (residential), with renewables making up around 40% of electricity generation (source: Eurostat)
* Spain: 20-30 € cents/kWh (residential), with renewables accounting for around 45% of electricity generation (source: Eurostat)
* USA: 12-15 ¢/kWh (residential), with renewables making up around 20% of electricity generation (source: EIA)
* India: 8-12 ₹/kWh (residential), with renewables accounting for around 10% of electricity generation (source: CEA)
* Chile: 15-20 CLP/kWh (residential), with renewables making up around 25% of electricity generation (source: CNE)
* Vietnam: 1800-2500 VND/kWh (residential), with renewables accounting for around 10% of electricity generation (source: EVN)

While the data is not directly comparable due to differences in currency and pricing structures, it suggests that countries with a high proportion of renewables in their energy mix do not necessarily have lower electricity costs. In fact, some of these countries, like Denmark and Germany, have among the highest electricity prices in the world.

This raises questions about the effectiveness of our current approach to reducing CO2 emissions. Perhaps it's time to rethink our strategy and focus on more practical solutions that can be implemented globally, rather than just setting an example that others are not following.
