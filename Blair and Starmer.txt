Summary: Blair and Starmer
Description: Tony Blair has become a deeply controversial and widely disliked figure on the British Left for several key reasons:

## Political Legacy

Blair's "New Labour" approach is seen by many on the Left as a betrayal of core Labour values:

- He embraced neoliberal economic policies and moved the party to the center, alienating traditional left-wing supporters[1].
- His government pursued socially conservative policies on crime, immigration, and welfare that were often indistinguishable from Conservative positions[2].
- Blair is viewed as having continued Thatcherism rather than offering a true left-wing alternative[2].

## Foreign Policy

The Iraq War is perhaps the single biggest source of animosity toward Blair:

- The 2016 Chilcot Report found that Blair exaggerated the threat from Iraq to justify the invasion, which has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths[2].
- His support for US foreign policy and interventionism is seen as a betrayal of left-wing anti-war principles[3].

## Post-Prime Ministerial Activities

Blair's actions since leaving office have further damaged his reputation:

- He has made millions through consulting work for authoritarian regimes and corporations[1].
- He continues to offer political commentary and criticism of the Left, refusing to retire gracefully[1].
- His interventions are seen as undermining subsequent Labour leaders, especially during Jeremy Corbyn's tenure[1].

## Perceived Arrogance and Lack of Contrition

Many on the Left feel Blair has never properly acknowledged or apologized for his mistakes:

- He remains unrepentant about the Iraq War and other controversial decisions[4].
- His continued presence in public life is seen as tone-deaf given his unpopularity[6].

In essence, Blair is viewed by much of the Left as having abandoned socialist principles, led the country into an illegal war, and then profited from his connections while refusing to admit wrongdoing. This combination of factors has made him a uniquely reviled figure among many Labour supporters and left-wing Britons.
