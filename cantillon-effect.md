What Is the Cantillon Effect?
When new money is introduced into an economy—typically by central banks or governments—it is not distributed evenly to all participants.

Those who receive the new money first (such as banks, large corporations, or government contractors) can spend it before prices have adjusted to the increased money supply. This allows them to purchase goods and assets at pre-inflation prices, giving them a financial advantage.

As the new money circulates through the economy, prices begin to rise. By the time ordinary consumers or wage earners receive the new money, prices have already increased, eroding their purchasing power.

This process causes relative price changes, benefiting those "closest" to the source of new money and disadvantaging those further away, effectively widening inequality.

Key Implications
Distributional Effects: The Cantillon Effect highlights that monetary policy can have regressive effects, often benefiting asset owners and financial institutions over workers and savers.

Market Distortions: The uneven flow of new money can lead to misallocation of resources, asset bubbles, and increased financial instability.

Policy Relevance: The effect is particularly relevant during periods of aggressive monetary expansion, such as quantitative easing or pandemic-related stimulus, where those with early access to new funds (e.g., large corporations, financial markets) benefit disproportionately.
