I went to a comedy night recently, where scientists did some stand-up. Yeah, me too! It actually wasn’t bad, and there was a decent audience. But the comedians were, how can I put it, very sad.

Going to university is great. Doing a PhD is great, especially if you get funding. Then you find there are no jobs. No jobs that actually pay, you know, more than a bar job. Well, I don’t know the stats, but that’s the vibe I came away with.

These gifted young people (some of them not actually so young!) were funny, but many of them made asides about how badly paid they were. One based his whole set on how once you become a post-doc, your whole time is spent writing grant applications. The more PhDs are created, the more post-docs there will be, and the more desperate people will be to get funding. So more time is spent by every group on crafting a wonderful grant application. But, as there is only one grant, this entire process becomes a sink of talent and enthusiasm.

One other talked about the reality of what a researcher actually does. She described how she had written a protocol for handling materials for DNA sequencing. It involved a lot of careful use of pipettes, as far as I can tell. I assume that this stuff is done by people who have PhDs. I assumed this sort of thing was done by lab assistants, like in the olden days, but I guess that post-docs are cheaper, now.

The show was entertaining, but I felt bad for the performers. To me, they seemed to be people who had been betrayed by the system. They had done all that was asked of them, but they now found that the system didn’t care about them any longer. There was no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, only a few miserable coppers.

The UK government has put great faith in transforming our dismal productivity by investing in infrastructure in an arc between Oxford and Cambridge. I cannot help thinking that they could actually do some manpower planning to try to reduce the elite overproduction that is evident at this end of the arc, anyway.

Nobody has much sympathy for a Cambridge graduate. They will never need to go on the dole, or pretend to be disabled to get a slightly higher state support. They will always be employable. But either the country needs to create a demand to match their supply, or we should cut off the supply, and tell the universities to stop accepting so many graduate students. Cambridge already restricts undergraduate numbers, but graduate numbers seem to grow and grow. There are too many PhDs being produced, and being used as cheap labour for tenured fellows. Surely!
