I was going to write about the UK planning system in an abstract way, 
but my ideas about planning have been formed from my personal experience, 
so I thought I'd write about it in concrete way, by giving an overview of 
my attempts to convert my former family home to flats.

Back in 2023, I decided that my old house was not realistically going to remain a family home.
It was big, but had a small garden, and was located almost next to the railway station on 
a busy commuter line. The natural trend, as places develop, is for the centre to become more densely occupied.

To this end, I spoke to an architect about submitting an application. After some discussion, he reccommended an outline application, keeping the exact layout as a 'reserved matter' (i.e. to be examined in a subsequent full application). The idea was to run the idea of converting the house to flats without spending a lot of money actually designing the structure. Because he was an architect, he included a few elevations to the application to give an idea of what the property would look like, in lieu of an "artist's impression".

The consultation process then required a half a dozen 'statutory consultees' (such as the people who collect the bins, and the parish council) to express a view. This was fine, and the architect discussed the application with the case officer who said that he (the officer) was minded to grant permission. Exactly what happened next seems to be that the case officer's superior took a look at the application and decided that it looked ugly, and so it should be refused.

Rather than having a refusal on file, I decided to withdraw the application. It was very unclear why the application was not going to work, and my architect at that point decided that he didn't want to work on the project. 

It took well over a year to find an architect who seemed to have a vision that remotely coincided with mine, about how to divide up the property. Having had such a bad experience with going down the outline application route, I decided to submit a full application. This is expensive. A drawing from an architect costs about Â£1,000 (and you need many), and even for the smallest plot, bat surveys and ecologists have to be employed a great cost to write reports showing how biodiversity can be increased by the project. Specialists have to write long reports detailing how the application is compliant with the planning rules that are applicable. (It seems that it's too much to expect the planning officers to actually know what the rules are, and know if the application is compliant. The applicant has to do the officer's work for him.)
