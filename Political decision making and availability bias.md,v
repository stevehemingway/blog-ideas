@# Political decision making and availability bias

Politicians are:

- rich, and law-abiding,
- clever, 
- used to dealing with large organizations which have the budget for lots of compliance,
- from families where educational success is the norm, and parental support is generous,
- resident in leafy suburbs remote from council estates and sink social housing
- familiar with employment with firms or institutions which have expensive but functional automation of routine tasks.

I don't blame them for being like that. I just feel they can make wrong assumptions about how society works in practice.
