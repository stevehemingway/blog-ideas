Democracy is a wonderful thing. 
It really offers a vision of the dictatorship of the proletariat. 
Politicians are elected by voters who are a shrewd judge of those standing for election.
Then those politicians are re-elected or not, according to their performance at delivering what the voters want.
But it doesn't really work that way, certainly in first-past-the-post systems.
That's because to get elected, politicians have to align themselves with a party.
The party offers a bundle of policies, most of which the voter will hate. 
The casting of a vote then becomes a reluctant choice of the least worst option.

When I was a child, the TV had just two channels. The programmes were designed to appeal to the widest possible audience.
