# The problem with builders

Builders come in all shapes and sizes, but for most ordinary consumers, the local builder is the only one they will ever deal with.

## The typical client-builder relationship

Most people don't even get to deal with a local builder; they live in a flat, and all major external work is done by contractors engaged by the management company, probably via the managing agent.

Some householders will engage a small builder to build a conservatory or a house extension. This is the sort of builder I'm writing about today.

## The contract and its limitations

This builder will enter into a suitable contract with the client, and will probably subcontract the actual work to 'the trades' (i.e., the individual ground workers, roofers, joiners, electricians, plumbers, decorators, etc.). The contract will probably be a template produced by the Royal Institute of British Architects, quite possibly the JCT Minor Works Building Contract.

The contract is just like the contract you have with your energy supplier, your bank, or even Amazon. You agree to pay money in exchange for a defined service. The law provides a framework through which you can obtain redress if you do not receive the service (building your extension) specified in the contract.

## The issue with limited companies

The problem is that your builder is probably a limited company, and that limited company probably has no assets. In the UK, there are volume builders like Persimmon and Taylor-Wimpey, and there are the guys who build your extension.

Actually, there are some middle-size firms that employ a lot of bricklayers, but are almost invisible to the general public because their only customers are the volume house builders, who don't actually employ any bricklayers.

## The consequences of incorporation

The guys who build your extension are probably incorporated. When Gordon Brown dropped the Corporation Tax rate to ten percent for small companies, every dog groomer and his dog incorporated. A year later, when the rate disappeared, it became easier to remain incorporated because going bankrupt as a limited company has far fewer consequences than doing so as a private individual.

## The risks for clients

From the point of view of the client, this is a very bad situation to be in. However good the Minor Works Building Contract is, it doesn't help a client whose builder has gone into liquidation.

## Mitigating the risks

The obvious reaction is to avoid builders with thinly capitalized corporations. But you can't! None of them put any assets, beyond the odd van and office computer and printer, on the balance sheet.

The usual approach is to talk to a lot of builders and possibly to their previous clients (or at least a few who will give a good reference). This can work, but it means that you have to have a lot of trust.
