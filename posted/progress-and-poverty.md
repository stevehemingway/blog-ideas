I am most of the way through Henry George's book, "Progress and Poverty."
Most people are aware of George's book, even though nobody much reads it now.
It's hard going: pages and pages of argument to persuade the reader that Malthus was wrong, 
which is hardly needed now. Malthus argued that the supply of labour would always increase
up to the point when the marginal return to work was (barely) enough to support life.
In a period of collapsing birth rates, globally, we hardly needs a tortuous theoretical argument to be convinced that Malthus was wrong. 

The other factor of production that George talks about at some length is capital. Oddly enough, a sort of Malthusian argument does apply to this: capital is created, up until the point where its marginal return is less than the prevailing interest rate: the equivalent of humans scratching a living.

George argued that all the increase in availability of capital and labour did nothing but flow into increased land values, land being the sole factor of production that is in fixed supply. The best tax is one which does not distort consumption, and a land value tax fits the bill perfectly. 
For some reason, this has come to be viewed as some sort of fringe, socialist project. In fact, the OECD itself has endorsed this as a tax [^1]. Note that the tax is just on the land value, separate from the value of the buildings on it. Rather than deterring development, it increases it, because it increases the cost of not developing!

There are problems with land value taxes, mostly that owners do not necessarily the income to pay the tax, and that estimating the value of the land is difficult. Many solutions to these problems have been proposed. It seems that lending owners would probably work, to deal with the first problem. A "Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax"[^2] deals with the second problem, at least in theory.

So, why, after many countries in the world have tried communism, gone back to capitalism, tried democratic socialism, has this sort of tax been tried so rarely? It's not as though George's ideas were not widely disseminated. Supposedly, his book outsold the Bible for much of the last decade of the nineteenth Century. 
Obviously, land-owners, who would pay the tax, have always been a powerful political force, in non-communist regimes. In communist ones, I guess the government owned all the land, anyway, so it would hardly raise any money by taxing itself. 

I suppose it must be the difficulty of 'selling' the tax to a sceptical electorate, which is not, in general, convinced that things should be taxed only when they have an inelastic supply. Let's face it, most politicians would be sceptical too. And splitting out the land value from the building value for the estates of the Duke of Westminster would be challenging, both practically and in terms of the court challenges. To be fair, New Zealand gave it a good go, collecting the tax, according to some formula, from 1878 right up to 1980. 

One way or other, some means of taxing wealth, both equitably and transparently, needs to be developed. The proportion of national income which accrues to labour has been falling for fifty years, and people have started to notice. The rich, so far, but knowledge has a habit of spreading further than you think.
