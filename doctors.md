Some people know what they want to be when they grow up from an early age. 
Others never work it out, no matter how old they get.
An old friend of mine knew he wanted to be a doctor from a young age. 
I am not sure how he knew, but I suspect that parental guidance might have had a lot to 
do with it.

I never really knew what I wanted to do, but I knew I didn't want to be:
a teacher, or an accountant, or academic (at least once I escaped from academia), 
or a prize fighter. I really didn't want to do anything that anyone tried to 
tell me to do. I didn't have a lot of empathy with the professionals 
who were employed to help me, probably because they seemed so smug and middle class, although that was a very small set of individuals indeed.

For some reason, I've recently joined the doctorsUK subreddit. I am not a doctor, 
in spite of my doctorate, but I find medicine, and doctors a curious lot.
